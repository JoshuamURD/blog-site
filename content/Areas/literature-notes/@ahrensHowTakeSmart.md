> [!example]- Note steps
> - This note should be created using the Citations plugin which links with Zotero to pull in its meta and bibliographic information.
> - If you're making a literature note in obsidian, it's because you've already annotated and read it or you're just about to.
> - Import the annotations you make from Zotero into this literature note.
> - Ensure that all imported annotations have fixed typos and do some minor formatting and sectioning out if necessary.
> - Once in the literature note, use the annotations to create [[tag-taxonomy#^ff04bd|an idea notes]]. Link back in the idea note to this literature note. 
> - Check [[tag-taxonomy|tag-taxonomy]] to see if this could have any topic tags. Give preference to existing tags over creation of new ones.
