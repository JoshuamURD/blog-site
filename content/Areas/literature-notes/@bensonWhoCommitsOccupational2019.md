## “Occupational Crime: Introducing the Concept” ([Benson and Chio, 2019, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/B2R4RDTY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZII8RRHV?page=2&annotation=24FYYUAG))

“Classical criminological theory provides many reasons for thinking that employment might deter criminal behavior. Rational choice theory, for example, suggests that money made from working should reduce motivations to engage in economic crime (Clarke and Cornish 2008)” ([Benson and Chio, 2019, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/B2R4RDTY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZII8RRHV?page=2&annotation=3D3RRCFT)) JJM - this idea challenges the idea that employment desentivises crime

“Likewise, anomity (Merton 1938) and differential opportunity theories (Cloward and Ohlin 1960) posit that lack of access to legitimate work enhances the attractiveness of crime.” ([Benson and Chio, 2019, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/B2R4RDTY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZII8RRHV?page=2&annotation=GPNMY9B5)) JJM - possible explanation as to why preconceptions don't align with reality ^fef6c1

[[why white collar crime goes unnoticed]]

“Social bond theory suggests that those who work have a stronger social bond and less free time than those who are idle, and hence workers should be less likely to engage in crime than non‐workers (Hirschi 1969). Besides preventing crime by reducing the motivation to offend in the first place, work is also thought to serve as an important pathway out for those who have fallen into a life of crime (Latessa 2012; Laub and Sampson 2003).” ([Benson and Chio, 2019, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/B2R4RDTY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZII8RRHV?page=2&annotation=3WATQEVX)) JJM - how classical criminology justifies its belief that occupation should provide a deterrent to crime

[[why occupation prevents crime]]

“it can sometimes have the opposite effect and provide potential offenders with opportunities and motivations for crime rather than keeping them on the straight and narrow. When crimes are committed while one is engaged in activities related to legitimate occupations, they are called occupational crimes (Clinard and Quinney 1973)” ([Benson and Chio, 2019, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/B2R4RDTY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZII8RRHV?page=2&annotation=XI3826CE)) JJM - why people commit occupational crimes ^a8902a

[[how occupation can provide opportunity for crime]]

“white‐collar crime was originally defined as a “crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation” (Sutherland 1949, p. 7), occupational crime includes crimes by people of less than high social status as long as the crimes are related to legitimate occupational activities. The overlap between occupational and white‐collar crime, however, is considerable, and much of the research to be reviewed here uses the latter term.” ([Benson and Chio, 2019, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/B2R4RDTY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZII8RRHV?page=3&annotation=FS4NXS49)) JJM - what is white collar crime...

[[sutherlands definition of white collar crime]]

“Occupational crime is sometimes distinguished from corporate crime according to whether the primary beneficiary of the crime is an individual or a corporate entity.” ([Benson and Chio, 2019, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/B2R4RDTY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZII8RRHV?page=3&annotation=QFY5E8WZ)) JJM - can "occupational crime" be distinguished from "white collar crime"? ^df37cb

“In short, the need to distinguish between occupational and corporate crime is debatable, but one thing is clear – these types of crimes are made possible by opportunities that arise out of legal occupations (Green 1990).” ([Benson and Chio, 2019, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/B2R4RDTY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZII8RRHV?page=3&annotation=9AR28LJI)) JJM - ultimate point author is trying to make is that occupation cleary is not objectively a crime deterrent contrary to common American belief

[[difference between occupational crime and corporate crime]]

“Sutherland (1949), for example, argued that white‐collar crime flourished because the world of business was permeated with attitudes and values that defined illegal business behavior in favorable terms and because American society was socially disorganized in regard to business crimes.” ([Benson and Chio, 2019, p. 105](zotero://select/library/items/B2R4RDTY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZII8RRHV?page=10&annotation=TZX85WA5)) JJM - Sutherland's argument for why occupational crime flourishes ^dcfa8b

[[white collar crime flourishes, perpetrators have considerable influence]]

“Others have argued that white‐collar crime is an endemic feature of capitalism and is promoted by the cultural values that underlie capitalistic economies (Benson and Cullen 2018; Messner and Rosenfeld 2012;” ([Benson and Chio, 2019, p. 105](zotero://select/library/items/B2R4RDTY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZII8RRHV?page=10&annotation=XRRJ6SEY)) JJM - Benson, et .al - occupational crime is a system feature of capitalism. ^a25388
