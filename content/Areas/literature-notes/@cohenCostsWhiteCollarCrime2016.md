([Cohen, 2016, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/H25YTBEM)) JJM - Breakdown of material in this book

“unknown about the costs of white-collar crime, providing national estimates of the costs of white-collar crime in the United States when they are available. A brief nal section discusses the major research needed in order to further understand the magnitude of white-collar crime costs and to use these estimates to better inform policy decisions.” ([Cohen, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/H25YTBEM)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GM2WGDLV?page=2&annotation=S2S8P8W2))

To summarize the main points of this essay: 
- There are numerous reasons for studying the costs of white-collar crime. Most importantly, it allows policymakers to put harms on an equal footing for purposes of conducting cost–benefit analysis as well as to compare the severity of crimes across types and over time. 
- The costs of white-collar crime go well beyond victimization costs. Business, government, and individuals all take costly actions to avoid and prevent becoming victims of white-collar crime. In addition, because many white-collar crimes occur in the context of legitimate business activities and often no mens rea requirement is included in corporate criminal offenses, businesses may take costly actions to avoid becoming charged with a crime. However, little is known about the magnitude of many of these avoidance behaviors. 
- In some cases, non financial victimization costs may be a significant consequence of white-collar crime. Costs may include physical or psychological harm to people and the environment in addition to serious harm to public con defence in political and/or economic institutions. However, the evidence on these costs is scant and there are no comprehensive victimization surveys establishing the magnitude of these types of harms. 
- Victimization costs that have been quantified total hundreds of billions of dollars annually in the United States. Once the nonquanti ed crimes are included, the total victimization costs of white-collar crime easily exceed the estimated cost of street crime in the United States. However, because avoidance behavior, precautionary expenditures, and other costs are not fully accounted for, we do not yet know how the total costs of white-collar versus street crime compare.” ([Cohen, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/H25YTBEM)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GM2WGDLV?page=2&annotation=N86DFYGY))
