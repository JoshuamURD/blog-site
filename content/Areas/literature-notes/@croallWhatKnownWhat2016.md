- white collar crime victimization is widespread and exceeds conventional crime;
- affects everyone;

“Sutherland’s (1949) definition, referring to white-collar crime as being crime committed in the course of a legitimate occupation or business, generally taken to encompass white-collar and corporate crime, raises many issues of inclusion” ([Croall, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/6RANYTTG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FNF5Y3E2?page=2&annotation=JYMCUX3W)) JJM - Sutherland's definition of white collar crime

[[sutherlands definition of white collar crime]]

“Critical scholars have queried for example whether the scope of white-collar crime should be restricted to activities specifically against the criminal law or should also include other illegal and harmful activities, particularly on the grounds that what is legally criminal changes over time, and business and corporate interests, from whom offenders are drawn, play a part in determining the “criminal” status of their activities.” ([Croall, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/6RANYTTG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FNF5Y3E2?page=2&annotation=P9DJAXT5)) ^13458d

[[criticism of sutherlands definition of white collar crime]]

“As offenders are carrying out their legitimate occupation, and are trusted on the basis of their actual or assumed occupational role and expertise, victims often are unaware of any harm” ([Croall, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/6RANYTTG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FNF5Y3E2?page=2&annotation=G2YPTU3Q)) JJM - white collar crime often goes unnoticed. ^e32297

[[why white collar crime goes unnoticed]]

“Victimization is also relatively invisible and often denied or not defined as such by the putative victims themselves (Croall 2007). Thus, victims cannot detect some offenses such as an excess of harmful chemicals in the air, in household products, or in food. Sutherland (1949) pointed to the “rippling effect” of offenses such as underweight goods or price fixing, in which individual losses are negligible but illegal profits are enormous.” ([Croall, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/6RANYTTG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FNF5Y3E2?page=2&annotation=4DIIB8TU)) The invisibility of victimization in victims of corporate crimes was a point contributing to Sutherland's discussion of the "ripple effect" in which crimes are negligible in effect to the victims but the accumulation of the profit is enormous. ^075f77

[[white collar crime victimisation, largely invisible, ripple effect]]

“Other activities, irrespective of their legal status, are tolerated widely and victims, even when aware of harm, do not define themselves as “victims” of “crime.”” ([Croall, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/6RANYTTG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FNF5Y3E2?page=2&annotation=4TVCIPNR)) ^0921a8
