> - This note should be created using the Citations plugin which links with Zotero to pull in its meta and bibliographic information.
> - If you're making a literature note in obsidian, it's because you've already annotated and read it or you're just about to.
> - Import the annotations you make from Zotero into this literature note.
> - Ensure that all imported annotations have fixed typos and do some minor formatting and sectioning out if necessary.
> - Once in the literature note, use the annotations to create [[tag-taxonomy#^ff04bd|an idea notes]]. Link back in the idea note to this literature note. 
> - Check [[tag-taxonomy|tag-taxonomy]] to see if this could have any topic tags. Give preference to existing tags over creation of new ones.

> *While data analytics capabilities have been developing over the last ten to twenty years there has broadly been a disconnect between business intelligence and the use of data for supporting learning-based hypotheses. For example, while data has been gathering in educational databases, the capability and know-how for using it to advance learning and improve the student experience has barely begun and only rarely been investigated (Ferguson, 2012).*

Data analytics is not as advanced as it should be considering the accumulation of big data in classrooms ^b0ddf5

> *The move of universities for example towards a more service-centred ethos often driven by rising costs of education and the introduction of student fees, has created an environment in which data has taken on an increasing value as a proactive tool for ensuring student recruitment, for lifting the quality of service delivery, and finding new ways to make cost savings throughout the sector.*

### Comments
An explanation for recent educational data analytic uptake is the incetivization of universities due to a "service-centred ethos". ^e2f71a

> *There is also evidence in the literature of new analytics tools being developed (Ali et al., 2012) and there are some early indications of how learning analytics might support personalization of the learning experience.*

> *game environments and social software communities have substantively altered the education landscape, the emergence of e-learning, online learning and reusable learning content have offered educators new and scalable delivery modes for education that may have substantial benefits for traditional campus based learners. However, the paradigm shift to immersive and personalized learning experiences necessitates dramatic changes in the infrastructure of our learning institutions.*

> *In this study for example, we estimated a financial impact of over two million dollars saved for every fifty undergraduate students retained into year two onward until graduation. On the way to bottom line impacts, data analytics can play a significant role in ensuring that current students get the highest quality of teaching and learning and the best support and personalised service to ensure that they are retained, achieve to their highest capabilities and enter into the workforce ready to compete on the global stage.*

> *Curtin University, along with other universities plans to reduce student attrition rates and increase year on year retention rates to 90% by 2017. As part of this ambitious target, over the last four years, Curtin has been undertaking a student retention study designed to analyse the main causes of drop out (attrition). This in part led to the Transforming Teaching and Learning effort, firstly, to redesign teaching, learning and student support systems and processes and secondly, to actively increase retention rates through better scaffolding, learning and student life service provision through an early warning system. The student retention research project has involved two studies over a four year period, working closely with Deloitte Data Scientists, the initial study in 2010 resulted in a new methodology for exploring existing student data. The second study undertaken in 2013 has resulted in the development of a highly granular dataset for retention analysis and reporting and a Student Discovery Model for modelling student retention over time. The Student Discovery Model uses a semi-supervised neural network algorithm to construct and place students into behavioural profile groupings. Future work will involve elaboration of the learning analytics strategy for the university with an ongoing implementation plan ensuring that the outcomes and implications of the research can be embedded university-wide.*
