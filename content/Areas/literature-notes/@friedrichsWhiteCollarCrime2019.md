“In part, at least, public understanding of the core definitional dimensions of conventional forms of crime – relative to white collar crime – can be attributed to the long‐standing pervasive media attention to such crime” ([Friedrichs, 2019, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/9T9B435L)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BR92LW4B?page=1&annotation=KMBH3K2R)) ^a19752

“White collar crime by its very nature lends itself less readily to being clearly – and dramatically – represented in journalistic reports, television dramas, films, and other media. There are various reasons for this that need not be addressed here (Friedrichs 2010; Robinson 2011).” ([Friedrichs, 2019, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/9T9B435L)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BR92LW4B?page=1&annotation=GBVX9LAR)) ^4c089e

“Although the most significant and consequential white collar crime has long been associated with organizations – principally, corporations – this way of characterizing crime is at odds with a deeply entrenched image of crime as perpetrated exclusively by individual human beings, and accordingly there is a bias in terms of defining crime in relation to actions that are carried out by individuals, working independently or in concert with others.” ([Friedrichs, 2019, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/9T9B435L)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BR92LW4B?page=2&annotation=CZ6MLNNI)) ^6c7f32

“What is meant by the term “white collar”? According to one dictionary, white collar is “Of or pertaining to workers, salaried or professional, whose work usually does not involve manual labor and who are expected to dress with some degree of formality” (American Heritage 1982, 1378). At a minimum, white collar people are employed; traditionally, they are middle or upper class, not lower class; they have a “respectable” status in society. C. Wright Mills (1956)” ([Friedrichs, 2019, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/9T9B435L)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BR92LW4B?page=2&annotation=PTAI96IB))... “Altogether, it would seem to be a mistake to imagine that the term white collar should be treated literally as opposed to metaphorically” ([Friedrichs, 2019, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/9T9B435L)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BR92LW4B?page=3&annotation=8QGDQ2C3)) ^3397ea

“An arrest by police officers and an indictment by prosecutors represent intermediary dimensions of a legalistic definition of crime. However, actions that appear to be a crime may turn out, on further examination, to be something other than a crime, as defined by the statutory law. But actions taken by criminal justice personnel – be they police officers, prosecutors, or judges – have demonstrable consequences in relation to “crime,” whether or not they are “factually” correct.” ([Friedrichs, 2019, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/9T9B435L)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BR92LW4B?page=4&annotation=3GEA7FPW)) ^b92241

“It is often said that all definitions of crime are “political,” insofar as in all developed societies (or societies that have developed beyond the tribal level) a political body of some sort defines crime” ([Friedrichs, 2019, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/9T9B435L)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BR92LW4B?page=4&annotation=EZQVD674)) ^9e4478

“Historically, the kinds of harms committed disproportionately by disadvantaged segments of society are far more likely to be declared crimes by law than are the harms committed by elite segments of society.” ([Friedrichs, 2019, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/9T9B435L)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BR92LW4B?page=4&annotation=4UL2RLX3)) ^36e50f

“The terms “power crime” and “crimes of the powerful” have also been put forth for those forms of white collar crime committed by powerful entities and organizations (Friedrichs and Rothe 2012; Ruggiero and Welch 2009). Other terms include economic crime, financial crime, commercial crime, business crime, marketplace crime, consumer crime, respectable crime, “crime at the top,” “suite” crime, official crime and deviance, political crime, governmental crime, state (or state‐organized) crime, corporate crime, occupational crime and deviance, workplace crime, employee crime, avocational crime, technocrime, computer crime, folk crime, and invisible crime” ([Friedrichs, 2019, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/9T9B435L)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BR92LW4B?page=6&annotation=EWF9ZWWU)) ^a6ebc6

““economic crime” as a preferred term. First, the term itself fails to capture one important core dimension of Sutherland’s “white collar crime” term: i.e. crimes are not simply committed by “those” people – i.e. poor people, minorities, marginal and disenfranchised members of society  –  but by members of the respectable and economically advantaged and privileged segments of society. Second, the term economic crime also implicitly sends a strong message that such crimes are exclusively economic in character, when it has long been recognized that some of the most significant manifestations of white collar crime – e.g. corporate violence – have huge physical consequences, resulting in death, injury, and disease for citizens, consumers, and workers” ([Friedrichs, 2019, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/9T9B435L)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BR92LW4B?page=7&annotation=WJUKLC9V))
