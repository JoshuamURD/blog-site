“Big Data Analytics (BDA) are the techniques, technologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications that analyse a vast amount of data to help an organization better understand its business, market, and make timely decisions (Chen et al., 2012)” ([Galetsi et al., 2019, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/MQTA7CHF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DGX4P2EZ?page=1&annotation=V8YET7G3)) JJM - note for what big data analytics is

“The use of BDA methods and techniques, such as optimization, forecasting, simulation, etc., is of paramount importance for the provision of meaningful recommendations and insights to managers and policy-makers when refining strategic decisions (Doumpos and Zopounidis, 2016).” ([Galetsi et al., 2019, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/MQTA7CHF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DGX4P2EZ?page=1&annotation=H2AFISXK)) JJM - Create note "Big data anayltics has impact on policy makers"

“Sociologists argue that data collected from groups of individuals using digital databases, e.g. social media groups discussing health issues, make visible aspects of individuals and groups that could not otherwise be perceptible. On the other hand, high public concern is raised too regarding big data ownership and health data privacy protection regulation (Mooney and Pejaver, 2018).” ([Galetsi et al., 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/MQTA7CHF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DGX4P2EZ?page=2&annotation=W9MFCIIN)) JJM - Create note "data analytics can provide insight" and another contrary note "data analytics can cause concern in the public"

“The data resources that the healthcare industry needs to appropriately handle in order to create big data capabilities are categorized according to Groves et al. (2013) in (a) clinical data, (b) patient and sentiment data, (c) administration and cost activity data, and (d) pharmaceutical and R&D data” ([Galetsi et al., 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/MQTA7CHF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DGX4P2EZ?page=2&annotation=G9UB9I2Y)) JJM - create note "sources of big data in healthcare"

“In healthcare organizations, the five most important BDA capabilities developed from data resources and appropriate analysis infrastructure are (Groves et al., 2013): (a)“monitoring,” includes efficiencies (using analytical methods) describing “what is happening now; ” (b)“prediction/simulation,” provides information about future outcomes (what will happen); (c)“data mining,” involves methods enabling extraction and categorization of knowledge (what happened); (d)“evaluation” that demonstrates methods for testing the performance of analytical techniques or explains the outcomes of the application of BDA (why did it happen?); and (e)“reporting,” includes methods that shape collected knowledge and provide it in an informational form.” ([Galetsi et al., 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/MQTA7CHF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DGX4P2EZ?page=2&annotation=8ZYKEWLP)) JJM - Create note "prominent applications of big data techniques in healthcare"

“Personal health-related data, which can easily be acquired from the use of devices (e.g. sensors embedded in smartwatches and smartphone log data), enables the continuous collection of social and behavioral data such as, communication intensity from calls, sms, twits, etc., which characterize social interaction, physical activity (steps count), sleep patterns and heart rate monitoring which affect mood and behavior (Banos et al., 2016),” ([Galetsi et al., 2019, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/MQTA7CHF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DGX4P2EZ?page=4&annotation=2XLM2DDE)) JJM - Create note "personal data collection, types of" (maybe concept note?)

“For example, Benharref et al. (2014) developed a decision–making tool, the “Fuzzy Expert System” that relies on data collected from continuous monitoring (health metrics), to produce recommendations (related to foodintake, medications, and lifestyle) for both patients and physicians by mitigating the risks of chronic diseases.” ([Galetsi et al., 2019, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/MQTA7CHF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DGX4P2EZ?page=4&annotation=URQ7KKCG)) JJM - Create note "the fuzzy expert tool is an application of data analytics in food health industry"
