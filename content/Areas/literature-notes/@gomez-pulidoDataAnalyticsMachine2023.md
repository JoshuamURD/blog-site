> *The widespread application of information and communication technologies in education, especially in the context of learning management platforms, is generating a large amount of data related to the academic activities in which students and teachers participate. These data stand out not only for their quantity and heterogeneity, but also for their relationship with the behavior and performance of the educational actors. For this reason, these data must be properly stored, processed and analyzed, with the aim of extracting knowledge that can be highly useful for improving educational processes. For this purpose, this Special Issue aims to present cutting-edge research on the application of advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques in education.*
