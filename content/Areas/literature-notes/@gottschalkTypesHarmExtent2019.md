“Occupational crime is financial crime for personal benefit. Individuals commit occupational crime for personal enrichment. They abuse their trusted positions in an organizational context (Friedrichs 2002; Gottschalk and Rundmo 2014; Hansen 2009; Heath 2008; Holtfreter 2005; Kang and Thosuwanchot 2017; Peltier‐Rivest 2009). Machen” ([Gottschalk, 2019, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/IM3GMLL3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GAWLP5DX?page=2&annotation=HLKXF8JY)) JJM - What is occupational crime ^17b867

[[difference between occupational crime and corporate crime]]

“Gottschalk and Rundmo (2014) found that occupational criminals receive a more severe punishment in court in terms of prison sentence, despite the fact that corporate criminals commit financial crime for far greater amounts of money. They speculate that judges consider offenders who enrich themselves to be worse criminals than offenders who enrich the organization illegally” ([Gottschalk, 2019, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/IM3GMLL3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GAWLP5DX?page=2&annotation=Z3FXF52C)) JJM - Judges in the past have been harsher to occupational crime as it is seen as a self enrichment which is perceived as worse than an organisational enrichment ^e2db6a

“Occupational criminals can find their victims both internally in the organization and externally. For example, embezzlement can cause harm to an employer, while fraudulent statements can cause harm to a bank. Insider trading can cause harm to other shareholders, while tax evasion causes harm to the society at large.” ([Gottschalk, 2019, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/IM3GMLL3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GAWLP5DX?page=2&annotation=83FS62KV)) JJM - occupational crimes can affect those internally and externally to the organisation. ^d44c53

[[white collar crime victimisation, largely invisible, ripple effect|white collar victimisation]]

“Hansen (2009) argues that the problem with occupational crime is that it is committed within the confines of positions of trust and in organizations, which prohibits surveillance and accountability. Heath (2008) found that individuals who are further up the chain of command in the firm tend to commit bigger and more severe occupational crime. According to Hansen (2009), individuals or groups commit occupational crime or elite crime for their own purposes or enrichment, rather than for the enrichment of the organization as a whole, in spite of supposed corporate loyalty” ([Gottschalk, 2019, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/IM3GMLL3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GAWLP5DX?page=3&annotation=7X5LRGP3)) JJM - potential reasons for why there has been a lack of victimisation or why they have been invisible. ^b3e2af

“It involves abuses of structural systems in the workplace in order to accomplish various forms of white‐collar crime (Sutherland 1983)” ([Gottschalk, 2019, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/IM3GMLL3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GAWLP5DX?page=3&annotation=8X7LK959)) JJM - Sutherland saw that white collar crimes arose out of an abuse of structural systems artificially created within organisations. ^dd67af

“It is violation of the legal codes in the course of activity in a legitimate profession (Friedrichs 2002). Occupational crime is committed on behalf of the individual offender.” ([Gottschalk, 2019, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/IM3GMLL3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GAWLP5DX?page=3&annotation=QGPTZJS7)) JJM - similar to Sutherlands idea of where white collar crime stems from, Friedrich suggests it is simply the violation of legal codes in the course of doing legitmate business. ^a26095

“It is committed by persons in an organizational setting for purely personal gain and to the detriment of the organization (Kang and Thosuwanchot 2017).” ([Gottschalk, 2019, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/IM3GMLL3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GAWLP5DX?page=3&annotation=6U5FDFCK)) JJM - what is occupational crime? ^08c169

“Holtfreter (2005) distinguishes between three mutually exclusive categories of occupational crime: asset misappropriation, corruption, and fraudulent statements.” ([Gottschalk, 2019, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/IM3GMLL3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GAWLP5DX?page=3&annotation=GJ9ENGPV)) JJM - Holdfreder's three categories of occupational crime ^4ab932

“fraud is one of the most, if not the most, voluminous crimes in most industrialized countries, with financial losses that eclipse all other kinds of crime” ([Gottschalk, 2019, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/IM3GMLL3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GAWLP5DX?page=3&annotation=2LF3RHZT)) JJM - this is interesting as it also resonates with the idea that fraud is a very hard thing for a lawyer to assert. Asserting fraud as a lawyer comes with risks to practicing certificates. ^4e7ea6

“Leasure and Zhang (2017, p. 604) found that the most common type of occupational crime is embezzlement, which is the appropriation of money for one’s own benefit: “The use of computers has increased the amount of embezzlement as they make this crime easier to commit.” Arrests for embezzlement in US banking rose significantly as computers became the preferred way of doing financial business. Occupational crime can also be the simple theft of company supplies and products” ([Gottschalk, 2019, p. 49](zotero://select/library/items/IM3GMLL3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GAWLP5DX?page=4&annotation=KKICZZ3N)) JJM - These people say the most common occupational crime is embezzlement ^7c6e8c

[[occupational crime, types of]]

“Leasure and Zhang (2017, p. 604) suggest that occupational crime can also be classified as professional occupational crime, which is committed by professionals such as lawyers, lawmakers, or doctors in the course of their jobs:” ([Gottschalk, 2019, p. 49](zotero://select/library/items/IM3GMLL3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GAWLP5DX?page=4&annotation=ITVJXQ67)) JJM - What is occupational crime? ^b1ab46

[[difference between occupational crime and corporate crime]]

“It has been suggested that white‐collar offenses represent victimless crime. Nothing could be further from the truth. A single scam can destroy a company, devastate families, ruin a bank, or cost investors millions of dollars. Occupational crime victims include employers, tax services, customers, banks, and shareholders, as discussed below. Reisig and Holtfreter (2013) studied elderly victims of shopping fraud in the United States. They found that two forms of remote shopping – telemarketing purchase and mailorder purchase  –  increase the probability of becoming a victim of shopping fraud. The probability of becoming a target and victim of shopping fraud was affected positively by reduced levels of self‐control. Holtfreter et al. (2005) conducted a similar study of consumer fraud, where they looked at consumers’ vulnerability. They found social vulnerability especially interesting, where socially determined lifestyles and patterns of daily activities have an impact on vulnerability. Social status can potentially influence their attractiveness as fraud targets, and may also contribute to successful victimization once targeted.” ([Gottschalk, 2019, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/IM3GMLL3)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GAWLP5DX?page=5&annotation=WRBC5BWJ)) JJM - The authors here assert, providing examples of how white collar crime offences are far from being a victimless crime ^d4fc4b
