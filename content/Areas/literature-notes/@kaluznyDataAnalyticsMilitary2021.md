“In 2017 The Economist published an often-quoted article stating that the world's most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data.1” ([Kaluzny, 2021, p. 970](zotero://select/library/items/PAPLJWNU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BACKN5Y3?page=1&annotation=H5ICKQB7)) ^00b8b2

“United Kingdom mathematician Clive Humby is credited with having said that “Data is the new oil. It's valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc. to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so must data be broken down, analyzed for it to have value.” Humby's statement emphasizes the scientific, insight, and decision aspects of data analytics.” ([Kaluzny, 2021, p. 970](zotero://select/library/items/PAPLJWNU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BACKN5Y3?page=1&annotation=DALPMGRX)) ^a8c038

“INFORMS defines operations research as the application of scientific and mathematical methods to the study and analysis of problems. Perhaps the key (if not only) differentiator between this definition and that of data analytics is the lack of the word ‘data’, or rather its substitution by the word ‘problem’.” ([Kaluzny, 2021, p. 971](zotero://select/library/items/PAPLJWNU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BACKN5Y3?page=2&annotation=FNDC75NH)) ^15011d

“Operations research scientists are perhaps the most perplexed with the rise of data analytics, having improved decision-making and efficiency in nearly every aspect of military operations, often analysing data.” ([Kaluzny, 2021, p. 971](zotero://select/library/items/PAPLJWNU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BACKN5Y3?page=2&annotation=LRXY3PLJ)) ^3294d6

“Sports science is one of the industries that are on the leading edge when it comes to data analytics. This presents an opportunity that researchers in military human performance must seize.” ([Kaluzny, 2021, p. 971](zotero://select/library/items/PAPLJWNU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BACKN5Y3?page=2&annotation=S57RM9KR)) ^a7e156

“illustrates different categories of data analytics and how they may map to potential impact (business value) and technical difficulty (analytics maturity). The categories are: • Data quality analytics: What do we know? How good is the data? • Descriptive analytics: What happened? • Diagnostic analytics: Why did it happen? • Predictive analytics: What will happen? • Prescriptive analytics: What should we do? How can we optimize? • Cognitive/semantic analytics: How can we influence a change?” ([Kaluzny, 2021, p. 971](zotero://select/library/items/PAPLJWNU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BACKN5Y3?page=2&annotation=DVX6FCWJ))

“The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) Fitness Profile (Fig. 2)is an example of data quality or descriptive analytics” ([Kaluzny, 2021, p. 971](zotero://select/library/items/PAPLJWNU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BACKN5Y3?page=2&annotation=4VU7AL3R))

“With the data analytics spectrum and data science capability Venn diagram in hand, military human performance researchers should not only identify where their strengths lie, but also understand areas of weakness and how they need to partner to truly operationalize their research via data analytics” ([Kaluzny, 2021, p. 972](zotero://select/library/items/PAPLJWNU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BACKN5Y3?page=3&annotation=ZPJLLMFE))

“responsible analytics respecting scientific development supporting decision making at the necessary speed of relevance.” ([Kaluzny, 2021, p. 974](zotero://select/library/items/PAPLJWNU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BACKN5Y3?page=5&annotation=M5A47KT4))
