“Our knowledge regarding white-collar o enders has increased substantially since the time of Edwin Sutherland” ([Klenowski and Dodson, 2016, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/YEZ79LRG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX9WAM8P?page=1&annotation=YBY74W8U)) JJM - ***This essay appears to expand on Sutherland's principles or at least recounts all the developments since Sutherland***

“In the subsequent pages, we summarize the research that has been conducted about white-collar to renders. Based on our analysis, we o er the following conclusions: • White-collar crime is a generic, yet relative, term that encompasses a wide array of illicit acts. A more de nitive typological scheme, similar to those created for traditional street o enses, must be established and subsequently applied before substantial empirical conclusions can be rendered regarding what know about the large spectrum of o enders whose crimes range from basic identify thefts committed by conmen to highly complex nancial frauds committed by corporate elites. • To date, a signi cant proportion of the studies conducted have yielded a somewhat consistent demographic pro le (i.e., age, race, gender, class, employment status, education level, marital status, community, religion, and familial ties) of the typical white-collar o ender. Based on what is known, a considerable percentage of white-collar o enders are gainfully employed middle-aged Caucasian men who usually commit their rst white-collar o ense sometime between their late thirties through their mid-forties. However, recent research has noted an increase in commission by both females and minority o enders for certain types of white-collar crime. Finally, most o enders appear to hail from middle-class backgrounds, have some level of higher education, are married, and have moderate to strong ties to community, family, and religious organizations. • Research on the criminal careers of white-collar o enders has determined that they usually have a criminal history, including infractions that span the spectrum of illegality—ranging from tra c” ([Klenowski and Dodson, 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/YEZ79LRG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX9WAM8P?page=2&annotation=PDZ2KSTU))

The limited body of research on whitecollar o enders’ lifestyles shows that a majority of them do not engage in an over-indulgence of vice (i.e., drugs, alcohol, prostitution); in fact, it appears that only low-level white-collar o enders make these lifestyle choices. • Although limited, the research regarding the personality traits of white-collar o enders has provided some promising areas for future analysis. Recent research that examined the ve-factor personality trait model determined that white-collar o enders tend to be more neurotic and less agreeable and conscientious than their non-criminal white-collar counterparts. The type A personality research could hold promise for gaining added insights about white-collar o enders, but it has yet to be thoroughly examined.” ([Klenowski and Dodson, 2016, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/YEZ79LRG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QX9WAM8P?page=3&annotation=4NBR7A8Z)) JJM - conclusions from the paper
