“There is nothing extraordinary about his situation, and it can hardly be said that the legislature did not anticipate cases such as his. ▪ 37 Regrettably, as each year goes by, the Social Security Act becomes still more complex, and less accessible to those who most need to understand it.” ([Notley, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/RMEE2KQQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZKMKGLD?page=24&annotation=WXBDVRBY)) Here the judge makes comment on how much more complicated and unaccessible social security is to those who really need it.

“Overpayments v Debt "The Government has an entitlement, a right, that ordinary people don't. It can convert an overpayment into a debt. The Social Security Act does that” (Simon Rice, a professor of law at the Australian National University, 2017)” ([Notley, p. 26](zotero://select/library/items/RMEE2KQQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZKMKGLD?page=26&annotation=XA44V9PV))

“How the mistake can be made There are two main ways: 1.Many people receive Centrelink payments for short periods of unemployment or illness. The automated program uses annual income data from the tax office and averages it out. If your boss has given the wrong dates to the tax office, or if you earned more some weeks that others, then averaging creates a false impression that you were earning undeclared income while you were getting Centrelink. 2.If the information you have given Centrelink about your employer is slightly different to that recorded by the tax office, it appears you have two jobs and didn't declare one of them to Centrelink. This can be as simple as a typo in the name” ([Notley, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/RMEE2KQQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZKMKGLD?page=27&annotation=JMM9CWC9)) JJM - How centrelink can mistake you easily for having two jobs which can put a centrelink payment as a debt.

“Many people report that they never got initial letters, and the first they heard of a problem with Centrelink was when they started getting calls from private debt by the department. ▪ This is likely because the initial letters had been sent to old addresses, or messages to myGov accounts people didn't check anymore. ▪ You have 21 days to log on and correct the record. You may be asked to submit payslips or other proof of income from up to six years ago. ▪ If you don't, the discrepancy is assumed to be evidence of an overpayment and a debt is raised.” ([Notley, p. 29](zotero://select/library/items/RMEE2KQQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZKMKGLD?page=29&annotation=Q659FMYI)) JJM -this is how robodebt used to work

“Social security prosecution Over payment ▪ Seek advise and if it can be challenged ▪ Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) Deception ▪ Interview invitation ▪ Must be voluntary ▪ Is taped ▪ Need legal advice prior Offence ▪ Centrelink will pass brief over to CDPP ▪ If offence can be proven beyond reasonable doubt ▪ Issue court hearing notice of charge and hearing date” ([Notley, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/RMEE2KQQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EZKMKGLD?page=31&annotation=NIZ844QV)) How prosecutions are done for different case types under the social security act
