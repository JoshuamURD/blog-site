“Data is also being accumulated in various web 2.0 and social media applications,” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=1&annotation=9GSSIPRG))

“such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, blogs, and wikis, as well as via email messages and mobile applications. The forms of data include numerical, audio, textual, video, and unstructured. These high volumes of data are collected for, among other reasons, compliance and regulation reporting” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=1&annotation=RVHLH8EN))

“exploiting their large datasets with advanced analysis to gain insight for making informed business decisions, thereby improving quality of decisions and business outcomes [1–8].” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=1&annotation=5E9S2BCE))

“effectively adding context, interpretation, and reflection [9].” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=1&annotation=FLVEKCS2))

“The key is to be ‘data-driven’ in decision-making. Let the data ‘reveal’ itself and inform choices.” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=2&annotation=8MLZTKIB))

“Businesses in the past have mostly applied descriptive analytics towards their cases.” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=2&annotation=GDJK6M66))

“Descriptive analytics is the type of analytics that is most understood and widely used. Being the earliest type of analytics to be introduced, it is by far the simplest to implement, since it provides a description of the data “as is” without any complex calculations” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=3&annotation=Y4PBVP7Z))

“By categorizing, characterizing, aggregating, and classifying data, descriptive analytics convert the data into useful information for analyzing business decisions and outcomes” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=3&annotation=J644G79U))

“Descriptive analytics helps answers such questions as, how many customers purchased a particular product in the past five years? What was our cost and revenue for the last quarter? What types of products, and how many of each type did we service? Which of the products offers the highest cost–profit margin ratio? Which customers should we target for special discounts? Which are the customers with high overhead cost” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=3&annotation=ADJ9YVMF))

“In predictive analytics, which is a more advanced type of analytics, there is emphasis on the use of information (versus data) [1].” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=3&annotation=MNB48D5S))

“future performance can be predicted” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=3&annotation=LFIHK22I))

“When a provider cannot effectively consider descriptive or predictive analytics due to the involvement of too many alternatives and choices, prescriptive analytics comes into play.” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=3&annotation=QDT3ICJX))

“Prescriptive analytics is deployed in business areas such as finance, marketing, supply chain management, customer relationship management, and others.” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=3&annotation=YAPW6R87))

“Discovery analytics is the utilization of wisdom or meta-knowledge (knowledge about knowledge) in the identification of new products and services (e.g., drug discovery) [1].” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=3&annotation=TN7U25XP)) This type of data analytics is used to create new products

“In addition to the four types of analytics, this study identifies three pillars of analytics that inform business modeling: visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning [19,30,33–36].” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=4&annotation=XCRKGZN2))

“Visualization is most appropriate for descriptive analytics and involves visualizing the data, including the various variables, dimensions, correlations, insights, etc.” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=4&annotation=BWY3TPKS))

“Statistical modeling involves mathematical modeling and representation of the data.” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=4&annotation=W8LZQKDE))

“Like statistical modeling, machine learning involves the application of mathematical modeling to the data. Machine learning is more data-driven, that is, the problem-solving (the identification of patterns) is found within the data” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=4&annotation=RQRYMVFF))

“Our methodology for a business analytics project covers the stages of concept design (conceptualization of the problem or need to be addressed), proposal (development of problem statement and the appropriateness of the analytics approach to address the problem), implementation (hypothesis/proposition development, data collection, analytics platform/tool selection, and application of analytic techniques to test the hypothesis/proposition), and finally, presentation and walkthrough to the stakeholders.” ([Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2021, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/D9FVAY7E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y64G47ZF?page=7&annotation=Q8Y2R7RH))
