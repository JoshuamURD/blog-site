“Sec 26(e) ✓ The sole means of taxing fringe benefits until 1986. ✓ Post-1986, superseded by FBTAA 1986 in respect of employment relationships. ✓ Continues to apply where the benefit is provided not in the employment context but in return for ‘services rendered’ (eg, Scott).” ([Syrota, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/M5AQNRKC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7X2CU7T7?page=7&annotation=7GIDZLXB))

“FBTAA 1986 trumps secs 26(e) / 15-2 in respect of employment relationships ✓ ITAA 1936, sec 23L(1). ‘Income derived by a taxpayer by way of the provision of a fringe benefit is not assessable income and is not exempt income of the taxpayer’.” ([Syrota, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/M5AQNRKC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7X2CU7T7?page=7&annotation=CJFVSMGR)) JJM - Create a reference note for the FTBAA 1986.

“Inherent weaknesses of secs 26(e) / 15-2 1. The benefit must be ‘provided to you’ (the employee). – If benefit provided to 3rd party (eg, the employee’s spouse/child), these sections do not apply. 2. The benefit must be provided ‘in respect of ... any employment of or services rendered by you’. – FCT v Cooke & Sherden not covered 3. Valuation difficulties. 4. Employees fail to disclose benefits in their tax returns.” ([Syrota, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/M5AQNRKC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7X2CU7T7?page=8&annotation=45G5UWR2)) JJM - this could go into the note "weaknesses of section 26" but make sure to try and expand in your own words these points why they'd be weaknesses

“Case 16 (1964) 12 CTBR (NS) 88. Facts The employer purchased a house The employer gifted the house to the employee's wife in return for the employee’s services. Held ‘[The section] is plainly inapplicable ... it could no doubt be conceded that the gift was made in respect of ... the taxpayer’s services ... and also that the gift was beneficial to him in the sense that, as the husband of the owner, he was able to use the property as a place of residence; but as the subject of the gift was land, the land was not “given or granted to him” and thus the value of the gift obviously cannot be included in his assessable income by virtue of s.26(e)’.” ([Syrota, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/M5AQNRKC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7X2CU7T7?page=9&annotation=HR9NU6ST)) JJM - Create note for "case 16 case summary"

“the defects of secs 26(e) / 15-2 1. Easily circumvented – Eg, by giving benefit to employee’s spouse/child 2. Technical problems in valuing benefits – Eg, company car used partly for private purposes • ‘value to you’ • no statutory valuation rules 3. An army of assessors and a battery of courts 1. Inequity 1. Previous attempts to tackle fringe benefits – (i) Abortive attempt to tax "stand by" value of cars – (ii) Abortive attempt to tax free/subsidised accommodation” ([Syrota, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/M5AQNRKC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7X2CU7T7?page=12&annotation=BZGXQ752)) JJM - include this in notes on weaknesses of section 26
