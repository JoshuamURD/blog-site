# Summary
Covered the fundamentals of tax which includes what a tax is and what it isn't. Some other words for tax and its characteristics. This workshop did not contain a significant amount but it have:
- A couple of significant cases which discuss what tax is and what it isn't;
- Some general understanding and background;
- That we have two income tax assessment acts and the reason for that is that at one point the government tried to make the old legislation more readable but ended up only doing a little bit of the revamp. So they're both the same Act, ones just easier to read and incomplete.
