> *This paper reports on one component of an Australian Government Office for Learning and Teaching (OLT) funded project entitled Learning analytics: Assisting universities with student retention. Carried out over the period from April 2014 to November 2015 this mixed-method study investigated the factors that impact on the implementation of learning analytics for student retention purposes.*

> *Thinking more holistically, Tinto (2009) suggests that to be serious about student retention, universities need to recognise that the roots of student attrition lie not only in students and the situations they face, but also in the character of the educational settings in which students are asked to learn. If one goes back to the definition adopted by the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR), which articulates learning analytics as “the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs” (Siemans & Long, 2011, p. 34), it becomes clear that student retention (and success and engagement) have a natural affinity with learning analytics.*

### Comments
The Society for Learning and Analytics Research believes there is a strong link between student learning retention and effective use of data analytics. ^32e192

> *A key message, consistently reinforced, was that participants generally expressed a high level of interest in learning analytics, but their participation in learning analytics activities was limited, particularly in a collaborative way.*

### Comments
Currently there is an industry lack of use in data analytics when it comes to education because there appears to be a deficit for teachers to collaborate on their methodologies in data analytics and systems. ^a6d96f
