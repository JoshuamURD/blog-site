# Summary

Conflict criminology is the belief that laws are not just consensus based (which our society presumes), some laws exist merely to look after the powerful and there is an absence of essential laws despite the observable need for their existence.

In exploring that idea, this workshop explained consensus criminology, conflict criminology, hedonism, determinism and free-will.

# Ideas

- There are two perspectives to criminology - consensus and conflict.
- The criminaloid (or a white collar criminal) is dangerous to society because "more dedoutable by far than the plain criminal, because he sports the livery of virtue and operates on a titanic scale".

## [[consensus model]]

- Consensus is about what behaviour should be criminalised based on society's values and the views or interests of those with the power to make laws. - these consensus theories can be attributed to [[social contract theory]] popularised by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau - the-social-contract|Jean Jacques Rousseau]] and Hobbes.
- We establish a consensus around norms present in our society. These norms include:
	- Folkways - e.g issues of politeness informal norms. Won't be a formal sanction
	- Mores - Norms which are more strongly held by society and may include a formal sanction.
	- Laws - Formal norms which are formalized in a legal policy and which usually come with a sanction or prohibition.
- Laws help push forward the times and if man is left to his own devices, in accordance with nature, man will take too much.
- consensus model is when citizens have a part to play in how and what laws are established. This is usually done by voting, protesting or electing officials with desirable policies. This creates a representative leadership.
- accept that power and value differentials occur in a society but the role of the State is to mediate these differences.

## [[Areas/university/conflict model]]

- Conflict theory was first developed by Karl Marx and it suggests that capitalism will inevitably generate margialised communities forced into crime.
- Isn't idealistic. Believes in representative democracy but believes that the power is truly held by the rich and the low-income tax payers' voice is diluted by the powerful.
- Believes that the dominant class will not make laws to enforce popular idology of crime but instead make laws on which are most helpful to their own class in a form of class solidarity.
- Observes that stricter application of laws by the dominant class are applied over time. This is because the subordinate class will often be forced into crimes by law of the dominant and instead of looking to explanation, attention is turned to the severity of the enforcement.
- The criminal justice system will struggle to reflect a divergent society.

## [[critique of classical criminology theory]]

- Inequality characterises society more than equality
- There is merit to taking a slightly deterministic belief to certain actions. Meaning that while we may have free will, some choices can be determined accurately based on certain factors. [[why is this a critisism?]]
- Some people do not act on a rational free will (e.g children, mental illness, illicit drug use).
- Deterrence is a weak influencer in the criminal justice system as it assumes apprehension of the deterrent. For example, short term gratification can seem more appealing than observed long-term consequences.
