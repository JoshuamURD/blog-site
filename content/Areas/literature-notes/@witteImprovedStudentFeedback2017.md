> [!example]- Note steps
> - This note should be created using the Citations plugin which links with Zotero to pull in its meta and bibliographic information.
> - If you're making a literature note in obsidian, it's because you've already annotated and read it or you're just about to.
> - Import the annotations you make from Zotero into this literature note.
> - Ensure that all imported annotations have fixed typos and do some minor formatting and sectioning out if necessary.
> - Once in the literature note, use the annotations to create [[tag-taxonomy#^ff04bd|an idea notes]]. Link back in the idea note to this literature note. 
> - Check [[tag-taxonomy|tag-taxonomy]] to see if this could have any topic tags. Give preference to existing tags over creation of new ones.
> - Once complete, click the checkbox above.

> *The growing number of students attending higher education institutions requires tutors to come up with solutions tailored toward these big groups, while maintaining the same quality of student support. A smart way for achieving such feedback is the introduction of automated feedback techniques, enabled by the vast number of electronic support systems that help teachers in their activities.*

> *Learning analytics surfaced as a separate research area only recently, enabled by the vast amounts of datasets generated by new supporting information systems, such as online platforms, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and so on. Seminal works includes the work of Siemens (Siemens and Long, 2011; Siemens and Baker, 2012), and Baker (Baker and Inventado, 2014)*

### Comments
A benefit of using predictive analytics on student data is to obtain insights into how courses should be adjusted if student's are not predicted to achieve well. It could indicate reason for course change. ^437478
