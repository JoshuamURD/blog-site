> [!example]- Note steps
> - This note should be created using the Citations plugin which links with Zotero to pull in its meta and bibliographic information.
> - If you're making a literature note in obsidian, it's because you've already annotated and read it or you're just about to.
> - Import the annotations you make from Zotero into this literature note.
> - Ensure that all imported annotations have fixed typos and do some minor formatting and sectioning out if necessary.
> - Once in the literature note, use the annotations to create [[tag-taxonomy#^ff04bd|an idea notes]]. Link back in the idea note to this literature note. 
> - Check [[tag-taxonomy|tag-taxonomy]] to see if this could have any topic tags. Give preference to existing tags over creation of new ones.
> - Once complete, click the checkbox above.

# Notes from last import: 2023-08-22 3:07 pm

For some reason this resource wouldn't extract with the plugin so I had to use the old method of extracting the annotations.

“we have proposed and implemented a sequential data analytics (SDA)-driven methodological framework to design adaptivity for digital game-based learning (DGBL)” ([Zhichun Liu and Jewoong Moon, 2023, p. 181](zotero://select/library/items/2HSNC8QY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J5C4PFUV?page=1&annotation=PVI8EQ3S)) Studies by data scientists have been conducted to use data analytics to develop adaptive game-based learning environments ^c92bda

“Previous works have demonstrated purposeful DGBL design that facilitates children’s CT skills development through playful learning (e.g., Asbell-Clarke et al., 2020; Bers, 2020; Israel-Fishelson & Hershkovitz, 2020)” ([Zhichun Liu and Jewoong Moon, 2023, p. 181](zotero://select/library/items/2HSNC8QY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J5C4PFUV?page=1&annotation=Y3HEP7CD)) As computational learning has been increasingly challenging with the level of complexity, data analysts have been turning to data driven game-based learning as a means of effective teaching of complex theories. ^d14ef4

“Whereas DGBL enhances engagement and motivation, research reports that young children may undergo cognitive distractions and ingame frustration easily (Lye & Koh, 2014; Bers, 2020).” ([Zhichun Liu and Jewoong Moon, 2023, p. 181](zotero://select/library/items/2HSNC8QY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J5C4PFUV?page=1&annotation=9UV6M5R3)) This competes with the idea that data driven game-based learning could be beneficial to students understanding advanced ideas.
