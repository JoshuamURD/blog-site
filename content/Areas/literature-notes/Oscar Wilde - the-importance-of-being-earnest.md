# Notes

## introduction 
- Oscar wilde was caught in a time when homosexuality was forbidden and pompousness was at an all time high. He was only allowed to speak as a jester; a mocking piece. His defiance to this society was to cleverly and disarmingly tell comedic plays critisicing their social constructs.

## importance of being earnest play
- he has a character called Jack who clearly is a projection of himself. Someone who doesn't quite fit in the pigeon holed society of his time.
- "*Relations are simply a tedious pack of people, who haven't got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.*"
- the aristocracy wish to be carefree and without nuance as the commoner but the poor wish to be like the rich. Each unappreciative of their class' attributes. Pg 313 
- Oscar Wilde is really good at pointing out absurdity in aristocracy by pointing out how irrational it is.
