The QEC method is when you identify in source material :
- the question or point which contains a proposition of some kind. This is usually denoted by underlining or highlighting.
- the evidence which supports the idea or proposition. This can be scientific, anecdotal, reflective experience etc. This is usually denoted physically with a dot on the page.
- conclusions are linking the question and evidence together. Once which form replacements to the sentence "by reason of X and Y we can come to conclusion Z". This is usually denoted with a dash on the page.
