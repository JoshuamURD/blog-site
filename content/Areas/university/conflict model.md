# Note

- Conflict theory was first developed by Karl Marx and it suggests that capitalism will inevitably generate margialised communities forced into crime.
- Isn't idealistic. Believes in representative democracy but believes that the power is truly held by the rich and the low-income tax payers' voice is diluted by the powerful.
- Believes that the dominant class will not make laws to enforce popular idology of crime but instead make laws on which are most helpful to their own class in a form of class solidarity.
- Observes that stricter application of laws by the dominant class are applied over time. This is because the subordinate class will often be forced into crimes by law of the dominant and instead of looking to explanation, attention is turned to the severity of the enforcement. 
- The criminal justice system will struggle to reflect a divergent society.
