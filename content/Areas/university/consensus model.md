# Note

- Consensus is about what behaviour should be criminalised based on society's values and the views or interests of those with the power to make laws. - these consensus theories can be attributed to [[social contract theory]] popularised by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau - the-social-contract|Jean Jacques Rousseau]] and Hobbes.
- We establish a consensus around norms present in our society. These norms include:
	- Folkways - e.g issues of politeness informal norms. Won't be a formal sanction
	- Mores - Norms which are more strongly held by society and may include a formal sanction.
	- Laws - Formal norms which are formalized in a legal policy and which usually come with a sanction or prohibition.
- Laws help push forward the times and if man is left to his own devices, in accordance with nature, man will take too much.
- consensus model is when citizens have a part to play in how and what laws are established. This is usually done by voting, protesting or electing officials with desirable policies. This creates a representative leadership.
- accept that power and value differentials occur in a society but the role of the State is to mediate these differences.
