# Note

- Inequality characterises society more than equality
- There is merit to taking a slightly deterministic belief to certain actions. Meaning that while we may have free will, some choices can be determined accurately based on certain factors. [[why is this a critisism?]]
- Some people do not act on a rational free will (e.g children, mental illness, illicit drug use).
- Deterrence is a weak influencer in the criminal justice system as it assumes apprehension of the deterrent. For example, short term gratification can seem more appealing than observed long-term consequences.
