# Note

- There are two applicable income tax assessment Acts (one in 1936 and 1997). They rewrote the 1936 Act in the 1997 Act to make it more readable after many amendments to the 1936 Act. However, the rewriting never completed and the 1997 Act represents the partially rewritten 1936 Act.
-  sec 1-3 of 1997 Act states that the wording differences between the two should be seen as the exact same as the old Act. It also notes that case law that applies to the 1936 Act applies to the 1937 Act insofar as they regard the same provisions.
