# Note
- If a law proposes to impose a tax, it cannot originate from the Senate, it must first be proposed by the House of Representatives. 
- Senate has limited powers as to tax law making. Can accept or deny the new law and not amend it.
- Tax is differentiated between a government service fee such as a postage stamp. It is an extraction of money for public purposes. A good indication that something is a service instead of a tax is when there is a direct and immediate benefit received. A tax would not have the promise of a specific and immediate benefit upon payment.
