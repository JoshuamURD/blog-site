White collar crime victimisation is largely invisible and has a "ripple effect" described by Sutherland to trickle down to everyone.

Another reason for its invisibility is that its often committed from a position of trust and in a place which prohibits surveillance and accountability.[^2] [[Sutherland]] said it was an abuse of structures within an organisation.[^3]

It is often the case that people believe white collar crime is victimless but the [[cost of white collar crime]] is actually significant:

Occupational criminals often find their victims both internally and externally.[^1]
