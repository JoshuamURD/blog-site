# 1. Summary of Main Ideas

# 2. Notes

## 2.1. Steps of Methodology

### 2.1.1. Capture Notes

- Fleeting notes and literature notes.
- Literature notes are anything that you consume and fleeting notes are ideas you come up with.
- Everything that's objectively interesting to your perception not your judgment.
- Practice noticing thoughts
- We aren't able to objectively have good judgment. We need different perspectives.
- You can always purge orphan ideas if you don't need them.

### 2.1.2. Process Notes

- Captures the idea first, then adds the necessary linking detail.
- Tags and search is the main way she organises information.
- Everything is saved in one big folder. She searches when she needs something specific.
- Makes notes atomic and makes it search friendly.
- Makes it simple so there's less friction in taking notes.
- Has links to questions, ideas, evidence and supplementary tools.
- We want our database set up to answer questions. Many questions will have the same evidence to support it.
- Making it search friendly
	- Tags - categorises the notes.
		- Question notes are tagged with "question". All questions can look at the tag questions to find the question she needs.
		- Ideas are tagged with a specific theme such as "counterintuitive" or "paradox" which are projects she's researching.
		- Uses tags to check status. for example
			- "build" is an idea note she wants to develop.
			- "check" is a note which needs to be confirmed for its accuracy or source.
			- "toread" interesting sources which need to have notes taken on their ideas.
			- "towatch" interesting sources which need to have notes taken on their ideas.
			- "newsletter" an idea she wants to develop in her blog. (much like what I want to do)
	- Uses dataview to query the tags she wants to visualise.
	- Uses keywords are in the notes:
		- Keywords in the title. To prevent data duplication and promotes data assimulation.
		- quickswitcher gives you a list of all the titles of your notes which allows you to search for keywords and be sure there is no note with that title. This allows you to predict what keywords you will search for later down the line making it easier to find by title.
		- Add keywords you think you'll find in your notes as well from in note search from the side bar search function.

### 2.1.3. Example

- There's an idea in a book she's reading about how sampling period can affect sport related injury data.
- Each anecdote supporting idea is a note on its own. It's treated as a building block
- Put it under the "West - similar" headings for each anecdote note.

### 2.1.4. Connect Notes

- Ideally there should already be two connections between a note which contains:
	- Questions and queries of some kind like what causes weight gain?
	- Sources containing literature notes giving evidence about various ideas. 
	- Conclusions/ideas which link sources and questions that they answer.
- Use the West, East, North, South methodology:
	- North - the theme or the question?
	- East - opposite or challenging views taken to this idea.
	- West - similar ideas which give the same vein of questioning.
	- South - where the idea may go in the future or what it may develop into.
- The point is not the connections but training your brain to think in that different way.
- The point is for these notes to turn into highly linked notes with your own notes that will be "permanent notes".

### 2.1.5. Produce Notes

### 2.1.6. Gather Reactions & Conversations from Notes

## 2.2. We Capture Notes to Find Them Again

Vicky Zhao mentioned that one of the main purposes of capturing notes is so we can find them again.
