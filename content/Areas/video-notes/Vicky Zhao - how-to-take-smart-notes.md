# Summary of Main Ideas

# Notes

## QEC Method

- Stands for question, evidence and conclusion.
- Vicky used this in law school.
- You only look for these three things when you're reading.
- It doesn't matter which order the author puts them in, you can still identify and link them together.

## Applying QEC Method to Physical Book Annotation

- Put a dot next to questions or propositions from the author and any conclusions taken from any evidence.
- For evidence or examples put a dash next to it.
- When you go back through the notes, try to identify which questions this evidence or ideas are trying to answer. Which evidence links to those conclusions or ideas.

## This is Excellent to Use in Obsidian

They are already atomic because each note is as basic as it can be. It allows each note to stand on its own without the need of the prompts of A -> B -> C you can start from anywhere either A, B or C and work your way through cause they're standalone ideas.

## Because they're atomic they can be assimilated to already known ideas

Because these notes are atomic, you can assimilate the knowledge to a vault, for example, and prevent data redundancy through well named notes with atomic ideas.

## How to expand on an idea and link it to make it "evergreen" - 4 directions method

First, you take an atomic note as the focus:
1. North - Where does X idea come from? Link it to evidence
2. West - What's similar to idea X? What are some other notes you have taken which touch on a slightly similar vein.
3. East - Whats opposite of X idea? Are there any notes you've taken or notes you could create which challenge the idea being presented in the note?
4. South - where can X idea lead to? Making predictions of future application on a note which can help in putting in practice notes taken here or for understanding limitations on a certain idea.
