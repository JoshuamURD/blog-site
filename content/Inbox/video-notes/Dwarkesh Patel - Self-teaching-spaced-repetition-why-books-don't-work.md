# Summary of Main Ideas

This video is about an interview with [[Andy Matuschak]] who is a crowdfunded researcher on "tools for thought".[^1]

# Fleeting Notes

These ideas are inspired from answers by Andy Matuschak responding to a question asked by Dwarkesh.

## Make reading personal
- Andy spent a lot of time on each page in a book - around 15 minutes. Very deliberate and intentional learning.
- When people do want to learn and they are able to connect the information that is meaningful and personal for them, we see a change in behaviour to desiring to absorb information.
- Andy recommends reading "How to Read a Book".
	- People who have books on their bedside table and fall asleep while reading these "aspirational" books. They aren't apprehending the words on the page. 
	- These people *want* to read these books but don't know *how* to read these books.
	- Connects this abstract idea with analogy of rock climbers, experienced vs inexperienced and a vertical surface.

## How to better identify gaps in knowledge

- Andy proposes that the skill of quick and effective identification of your knowledge gaps is one that could be built upon. 
- The most important in active reading is creating questions for yourself and answering them. Dwell on this. How should I go about answering a question with this dialogue with this author when the author isn't present.
- "An undemanding reader asks no questions and gets no answers". - @6:20
- Andy personally even found that the issue wasn't a failure to remember things but that he hadn't truly engaged with the text he was reading and his eyes just "skidded across paragraphs".


- When you're doing a lot of cognition, meta cognition is difficult. When you're thinking really hard about the meaning of the words on a page, its hard for you to regulate yourself (planning next steps, formatting, paraphrasing, whether you're understanding things, asking questions).
- Outsource metacognition
	- Syllabus tells you what to read and when. When Andy is learning a big topic he goes and download's a course syllabus from somewhere to understand what sort of topics are most important.
	- Outsource the question of what is necessary to know. Treat even what seems like "unnecessary" knowledge as necessary. This can be done with a syllabus or textbook. 
	- Syllabus provide "scaffolding". It provides context on what to proceed on. Lets you know what you don't know.
- In the augmented online book Andy is developing on quantum mechanics, they have review questions pop up every 1,500 words which prompt the users on whether they truly understood the text or not. Distinct from not remembering, it might be that you don't understand a word that was important and you didn't even notice it was important from that text you just read.
	- Found that readers were slowing down and reading more carefully.
	- Adjunct questions that "go along with the text". Have the effect of making you reflect on what you just learned. Why does X matter?
- Learn how to apply knowledge in several different contexts.
- Tyler Cowan sounds interesting, look him up. Writing obligations and prolific publisher. 
- Andy recommends daily writing in some form of literature or non-fiction writing daily. 
- Memorization is for learning more trivia. But more importantly, it allows for these connections to be created between different ideas. Much like the obsidian zettlekasten helps facilitate.
- Your memory to understand something difficult will absolutely be bound by your ability to understand the constituent material. 
- There doesn't seem to be a limit to well system trained memories.
