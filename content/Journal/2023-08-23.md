# 1. Ideas - Original Thoughts for Projects or Posts

Make reading non fiction like having a dialogue with the author.

What if I made a website that allowed books to be fed to it and then it used that material to teach others its contents through dialogue and repetition. 

I should create a blog and maintain a writing obligation in which concept notes are published which are spellchecked and referenced.Social interaction is okay too but not mindless scrolling. 


# 2. Reflecting - Reflection on Your Own Thoughts for Stoic Meditations

I need to develop a better relationship with technology by limiting the amount I use it for non learning. Social interaction is okay too but not mindless.

Whenever I have a free day at home. In efforts of mindfulness and a reminder of conscious awareness, I keep my watch in hourly beep mode. Each time it beeps, it prompts me to disengage with my task, check the time and mentally check myself if what I'm doing at that time is necessary and a valuable spend of my time. It makes every decision of every hour a conscious choice. I don't dwell over it very long but it has often broke a distraction caused negative feedback loop consisting of the typical mindless social media scrolling.
