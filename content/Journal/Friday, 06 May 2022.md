# Daily Log
I tentatively say that I feel a lot better today. By the end of tonight I almost have no symptoms except for a slightly blocked nose. Think I sneezed out most of the virus today.

I spent most of the day playing Dying Light 2 and reading again. It's starting to get a little old. I'm itching to leave the house. I had the first cravings for a vape that I'd had while sober for a long time. I suspect it's because its been the first week in a while that I've not even had a few puffs from one of my friend's vapes.

Tonight I spent a lot of time socialising. Laura was very upset and started accusing me of all sorts of things like leading her on and began spamming me with several messages. She managed to cool down eventually but proved to me more and more that her and I wouldn't work. She reminds me exactly who Sarah was at her age which terrifies me. I cannot be more sure that her and I wouldn't work long term. I began to question whether that was real or whether that was my avoidant attachment style. But her traits are too similar. I have no doubt that something like what had happened between Sarah and I would happen again between her and me. Which confirms to me without a doubt that we wouldn't work.

I confirmed with both Lachie and Jordan that I would go to the bush doof that weekend and would not attend Megs. I feel bad as I had hit going a while ago and she had asked her plans first. But the thing is, if I went to Meg's 21st I would not know anybody and I know I would be going only to entertain Alex, who hasn't been a great friend to me, this past 3 years or in high school come to think of it. 

I have been speaking to Kris more lately. I've been trying to build upon our friendship which had taken a turn for the worst the past 2 years. Don't get me wrong, we had never been close. But there was a period of time where we highly respected each other. Somewhere along the way that got lost. I'd be lying if I'd said I wasn't partly to blame. I'd always seen him as an average person and judged him on his intellect. Which is wrong of me. I'd also been quite average to him while he was living at the house, I definitely could've handled things better, I knew better at the time and chose not to be more patient for the drama of it. Which I can do sometimes. After starting to speak to him more often on Snapchat. I sent him an apology for the times that I'd been absent during my heavy weed smoking days. He humbly accepted, which I appreciate from him. I think as much of an idiot he can be, he's got a kind heart and he's just slow at catching up in maturity. I should give him the benefit of the doubt more often and remember that.

I asked Chelsie whether she wants to go camping with me next Friday night to Julimar. I was a bit tentative as to whether she'd say yes or not, and to whether it would freak her out. It is a bit soon for me to ask. I know I have a tendency to rush things. I just feel like I've got a very quick understanding of whether I like someone or not. I should understand that this is probably part of my avoidant attachment style. It's just I really want to know quickly whether someone is my fit or not. I think Chelsie will be. I've got my brain giving me small imperfections as to why we wouldn't work. But I think I can see a genuinely kind person. The type of person who's willing to do anything for those she cares about. That's one of the only things that really matters to me I've found. I need that person I can rely on when things are shit. When I'm too drunk and need help walking somewhere, I need someone I can sling my shoulder around and can have a laugh about it. I don't want to idealize her too much before getting to know her, but that's the kind of person my gut is telling me she is. Anyway, she said yes to coming camping. At first she asked if it would be just us. I thought this was a sign that she'd feel uncomfortable with me making this step so soon, so I told her that it was original plan for it to be just us but I could invite others if she'd like. She told me she'd prefer it to be just us and it made me smile. She's told me she's really excited for it and can't wait, especially since she hasn't been camping in ages. So I've started creating a checklist of things I need before I go. Including, things I need to buy from the camping store such as a new chair, lights and such, and food I need to get from Woolworths as well as a general checklist of items I need to pack. I'm excited to be doing something this intimate with someone, especially someone I'm excited about. I feel like I haven't been with someone yet since Sarah who's made me this excited to go away with them. 

Both Laura and Jess as much as I hate to admit it, though they could never know, were just rebounds to me. I did not think this at the time and I definitely would never intentionally use a woman like that. It's only now in hindsight that I can admit this was the case. I was never excited about either of them. They similarities they both had were they were simply really keen on me and I felt strong around them. When I say strong, I don't mean that in the sense that a toxic male needs to be. I mean emotionally. I felt like because I knew they were so keen on me, I was in no danger of being hurt. But I did not have the excitement that one needs to start a relationship. The spark. With Chelsie, I have this feeling of excitement of possibilities with her. I find her incredibly physically attractive and I find that she is a really kind person, she gives a lot to people, even though sometimes in naivety. She has been through hard times and is compassionate in knowing what it's like to feel alone. She's hardworking but she doesn't want to be. Her mum instills a lot of pressure into her and so she barely ever has the time to pursue her true dream of baking. She's an excellent baker. She's entrepreneurial - she's got her own cookie baking business. All these qualities are ones that make me really interested to see what opportunity for us as partners could be. I feel like I've broken the ice enough with her that she'd be capable of seeing me as a potential partner.
