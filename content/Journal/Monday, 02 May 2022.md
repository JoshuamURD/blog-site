# Daily Log
Today I was meant to go to work but mum had tested positive on a corona virus RAT test. I didn't feel ill but she concluded it was best that I did not attend work considering there was immuno-compromised individuals there. I instead spent the day going for a walk, reading, playing some Metro Exodus and organising a second catch up with Chelsie. 

The catch up with her on Sunday went really well. We cuddled the entire night and she began to open up to me more. At the end of the night I gave her a kiss goodbye, she responded bashfully "if you want to". After she got out of the car, she seemed to be beaming smiling at me. This reassured me that it was something she was actually happy that happened. On my drive home, I called Lachie to inform him on the success. I also told him about the conversation I had had with Laura the night previous, which he responded by telling me it was probably for the best. There was not really any news with him when I questioned. 

Anyway, Chelsie finished work at 4pm today and so I'd organised a catch up with her after I had dinner. She sounded keen to catch up. I picked her up at 7pm and when we got to my room we cuddled again for the whole night, I had put on a movie but we didn't watch it, we just chatted about life. It was really good to see her opening up to me, I feel like I'm finally getting to know the real her. She told me about all the times she's been fucked over in the past. How she's been cheated on, guilted out of money (the story to me seemed a bit on the naive side) and how what she really wanted was someone she could spend forever with. She sounds to have a similar mindset as I do. But I will say, I noticed some traits of an avoided personality type. She said that when she looks for a partner now, she tries to see very far into the future about whether they would work or not. While this seems nice, and something that I like to briefly explore in my own thoughts about potential partners, it also indicates to me that she might have unrealistic expectations of people she sees as potential suitors.
