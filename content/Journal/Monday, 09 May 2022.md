# Daily Log
Yesterday I went and bought a bunch of new camping gear. I decided to go camping with Cody and Lachie to Julimar which was fun.

Today, Chelsie cancelled the camping trip we had organised. She said it was due to her health problems she's experiencing related to her ovaries. I understand that, but still was slightly disappointed. 

I feel like I'm starting to catch serious feelings for her. Which is scary. Whenever something like this happens, where she cancels on a step which would progress our closeness, I worry it means that we aren't on the same wavelength or that I've deluded myself into thinking that she likes me like I do her. She has reassured me by saying she thinks we have a vibe. 

I'm not sure whether I should be trying to stop these feelings from developing or not. She's also told me that she's now taken the reception job back up. This worries me, because I'm getting the impression that if we were to date I'd constantly be battling for her time because there would be so little of it that is free. I admire that she is capable of being so hard-working but my concern is that she doesn't have an idea of balance. Based of what she's told me as well, this has been the cause of her losing a lot of her friends. I should take this into consideration if the time comes to decide whether we should be more serious or not. 

She has reassured me that she's really bad at explaining on text. I think I do have a lot of preconceived notions on texting etiquette that affect my view of this situation. It's done so in the past. But that will become an even greater issue if I never get to see her and most of our talking is done on text. I'm not sure. I will need to think about this more.
