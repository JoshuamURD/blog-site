# Daily Log
Things have been doing better. Lachie and Chelsie broke up. Can't say I'm too sorry for them. It's been a while since I have spoken to any girls. Starting to feel lonely. I feel like I have all that capacity for love and no where to put it. I know there are still things I need to fix though before I'm back to my full confident self. I need to lose the weight. I just need to do it. It's the one thing that still gives me grief and limits my confidence. I am always sucking in and it makes long outings tiring because I'm constantly tensing my abs to try and prevent my gut from showing. I know it's stupid and no one cares more than I care about it. But I can't stop from thinking about my weight. I think it's because most of my life I've been pretty content with the way I look but the last two years have been the first time I've truly thought I look unattractive. It has meant that I don't approach girls and honestly, I think girls don't approach me because of it. I've not got the right personality for my age group at the moment. I'm not into shallow talk and I can't find myself amused by shallow humour. I feel like I'm constantly faking my laugh, smile and enjoyment. It's helped stopping wanking and going to sleep at a consistent time. I feel like I have less time spent in limbo from being so fucking tired and endorphin overdosed. I suppose the benefit of my womanless life at the moment is for the first time in a very long time, my whole life isn't made about women. I always put them first and my whole life revolves around it. I think I find that having a girlfriend keeps me grounded and without one I often times feel lost and alone. I'm not sure why my friendships aren't enough for me. They are great and I tell them everything. It's just not the same.
