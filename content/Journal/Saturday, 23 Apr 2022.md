# Daily Log
Yesterday was Kris' birthday party, his 21st. It was a boat party that left from the Barrack Street jetty. Amir was very unwell and had to be carried off the boat and we placed him in a taxi, giving the taxi driver Amir's $150 in cash. We told the taxi driver to only keep what was necessary if he were to vomit. I'm now informed that he took the entire amount. Asshole. After that, Lachie and I walked to Magnet House where the rest of the group had gone to. Unfortunately, I'd had a few puffs of Lachie's vape on the way. But I think considering how that's the only time i've vaped lately, it's ok. At Magnet House Lachie was dancing with Madison Lowe the whole night. I eventually left because I lost everyone once I'd gone to the toilet. I was okay with that though as I didn't want to be too hungover for today, Sam's buck's night. I still feel a little hungover today, but it's mainly brain fog. We will be staying at the Crown tonight.
