# Daily Log
Update. Chelsie and I have slept together. Last week spent almost the entire week seeing each other. It was the first time I have started to feel something for someone since Sarah. Something that I could see a future about. But this week I have been seriously let down. Her entire week this week was busy with work, which is understandable. Are plans to catch up mid week were all cancelled due to being tired or work going into overtime. Again, understandable. However, we had plans for tonight, I was hoping to go out on a nice dinner date with her. I told her this. But this morning she told me she had to watch her cousins at 12pm - no big deal I thought. The entire day she ghosted me, with the occasional text in between saying sorry she's still busy. I had Clay asking me if I wanted to go see Ocean Alley tonight - I said no because I have plans with Chelsie. It is now 10 past 9pm. I haven't heard from her in over an hour. I am feeling quite angry. I feel like again, by a women, I am being made a last priority. I haven't even been given the common courtesy of being told that she's unavailable for tonight - which still may have disappointed me, but does not compare to being ghosted and left unaware. It gives me this anxious feeling. This waiting by the phone feeling. I hate it. I know that this may be karma for all the times I have cancelled plans on people. But I have always at least had the courtesy to tell them I'm unavailable. I would've gone to see Ocean Alley had she told me. She hasn't cancelled yet but knowing her pattern recently, she's going to contact me at a time like 10pm and say "I'm so so sorry. I'm too tired now and going to bed". I feel like a needy, desperate person. Even though that feeling is not justified in any way - what I'm asking for isn't a lot. I'm now starting to recall all the experiences she's told me with guys in the past. How they'd become these clingy and desperate people, constantly calling her and being angry with her for working. I think I'm starting to understand the pinch of salt that comes with her side of the story. I think while maybe those guys, with a complete lack of dignity, did call her frequently and spam her incessantly, that they did not become that way for no reason. I think that she's had a habit of doing this for a while. Putting men who she speaks to at the bottom of her list. Anything with her family or work that comes up will cause the plans with the guy to drop off. I know that this is probably a defense mechanism she has learned to remain self-reliant and avoid intimacy. The real question is: do I want to stick around to sort out a way I can work with that or do I duck out?
I suppose I'll have a chat with her and judge her reaction. Regardless, I need to make sure I don't cave and let her use an excuse for this. I can't set a precedent that this is okay. She is clearly an avoidant personality-type. Everything about her doesn't match up. She tells me in person that I'm exactly who she was looking for and that she's got strong feelings for me. But then the following week, everything screams the opposite. If I were someone else, watching only the behaviour she has displayed this week, I'd be saying she's not interested - get the message. I just feel annoyed at myself for allowing my heart to open up to someone too soon. I know better than this. I just got excited about the idea that I could love someone other than Sarah. That I was over her and that there are more people out there I can love. I hate that everyone in my age group is not like me. I have so much love to give. I don't need a partner, it's not a necessity. But its the one aspect of my life that I want to be better. I'm happy with my job, my degree, my group of friends. I just want someone I can have an intimate partnership with. Someone who I can open my heart to and not feel stupid for doing so. Everyone my age is fucked. They all are either getting out of their first serious relationship, and aren't interested in another, or they've been single this entire time - for a reason. There doesn't seem to be much in between. I know now I need to kill my feelings for Chelsie. They have come too soon and will only hurt me one way or another. Either they will scare her off, because she herself is afraid of intimacy, or she has already decided that she's not interested and I'm doomed anyway. At least by killing them now, I can play it safe. I know that I can regain them down the track, once I'm sure that we will be serious. There's no point in getting my heart stomped on again and being back to square one for something that wasn't even worth it. I still even have my skepticism as to whether we'd work as a couple anyway. She has a very different sense of humour to me. Her texting skills are appalling - which considering that she's so busy so often, are not a good thing. She doesn't seem to make any effort whatsoever. So far, everything that has happened between us has been me pushing it along. I don't mind getting the fire started in the relationship, but once its going, I like to know the other person is adding wood to it. No innuendo intended.
