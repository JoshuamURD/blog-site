Yesterday was Sam and Kerry's wedding the ceremony was beautiful. All the McCarthy boys cried. So did Cody Melville. It was an excellent night. 

I went to the Karrinyup shops with mum and bought some new clothes including some cargo pants, a shirt and some Vans. The shops are massive and while we were there I ate a pork broth ramen called Tatsuku ramen. It was quite nice but still nothing beats my favourite, spicy miso ramen. 

I told Laura that I was no longer interested in seeing her. The conversation was one that had meant to occur in person but she had asked me whether or not she could see other people, since we weren't a thing. I'm not entirely sure whether or not she had intended that as a way of pressuring me into securing her more or if it was a genuine attempt to express a desire to see other people despite her speaking to the contrary only a few days prior. She was upset for me but for a moment before completing a pre-mature complete 180 on her view. I think she did this in a sudden fear that I would no longer be in her life at all. Something I would do. In her anger, she kept mentioning Chelsie and how I should "go fuck her" despite there never being any indication that was of interest to me.

Funnily enough, and despite being a bit cruel of me, I did end up calling Chelsie to see how she was doing. She agreed to meet up with me, but as per usual on the phone she sounded mildly disinterested in me as a partner. She did sum this up to be the fact that we hadn't known each other long. But I can't keep avoiding the impression I'm getting that she views it that she is 'settling' by the idea of being together with me. I can't deny that this may just be a fear of my own creation - she is quite attractive. But that is all she is to me right now. I am trying to adopt the lessons I've learned from my reading of Attachment by Dr Amir and not use any distancing strategies that I use as an avoidant attachment type. I'll see how I go and report back in tomorrow's entry.
