# Daily Log
It was dad's 54th birthday party yesterday. David and Macgregor came over and I was still feeling a little bit hungover from having the Amir, Kris, Lachie and Mitch over from Friday night. We ordered Shisha from HabibzShisha and it was really cool. Unfortunately I did have 4 puffs of a vape. It felt good but I am going to remain determined to stop. I'm not a vaper anymore. Anyway, Dad's birthday was cool and I had only had 4 cans of mixers and 1 whiskey on the rocks but despite that, today I still woke up with a bad migraine. I was meant to see Sarah last night but she ended up pushing back the time for me to see her to 1am because her sister was over and she told me she'd have 'sneak me in'. It was 12am at that point and I was exhausted so I'd said no. Interestingly as well, I decided to text Cassie Atlas who I haven't spoken to since 2019. She's told me she's single now and we've agreed to catch up sometime this week for a coffee. 

Lachie and I were mean't to go hiking today but I couldn't be bothered and also was worried about my migraine flaring up once we were out there and that would be an unpleasant experience. He says he still wants to catch up but after living with the dude for a year and a half, I kind of want a little bit of a break. I'm too much of a pussy to tell him which is shit, so I've just said I'll get back to him but will probably be too hungover even though I could tough through it.

I am catching up with Hattie today though. I'm still not sure whether or not I want to pursue something with her. She's really smart and got an attractive personality but everything else about her, my instincts scream "NO". Suppose I'll see how it goes.
