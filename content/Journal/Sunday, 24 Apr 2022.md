# Daily Log
Yesterday, I stayed at the Crown Promenade with Cody, Tea, Clay, Kris, Jordan and Lachie. We were on the second level and Lachie, Jordan and I were in one room and Cody, Tea, Clay and Kris were in the room opposite us. We stayed there because it was Sam and Kerry's engagement party. After we had checked in, we went downstairs to the bar called Market & Co. I ordered a long island ice tea and some wedges. Once Sam and Kerry joined us and had a couple drinks we all made our way over to the Empire bar. The whole night I took Jordan and Mitchell's vape. This morning I woke up craving it a little. But, I think I've got it under control. We stayed at the Empire bar for a while and then we walked back with the people who were staying at the hotel that I mentioned and also with Mitchell, his girlfriend - Keshvi and her friend Maddie Hatchely. Who spent the entire night crying about Ethan Barwick. As we were walking back, Mitchell left Keshvi along with the rest of the group while Mitchell held Maddie's hand. I waited for her while she did a pee. It took her ages to walk back with me to the hotel. When we got there Mitchell thanked me for looking after her. I wanted to go to the casino but everyone was ready for bed. So I went with Tea, Kris and Cody to the McDonalds. I feel like when I'm with them most of the time, I'm just a spectator. I don't feel like they even notice my presence. But then again, I don't often have anything to say to them because I just can't really connect with them. Kris abused the lady working at the Mcdonald's because Cody had forgotten her order (and thought it hadn't been called out) and he has a compulsive need to feel like a tough guy in front of the girls. When I got back to the hotel room, Jordan had changed his mind about going to the Casino. So we went with Tea while the rest of the group stayed. I played blackjack and won $50. My method was basically to not be hit if I was over 16 and to double down on my bet if I lost (I was betting the minimum amount each time usually).
