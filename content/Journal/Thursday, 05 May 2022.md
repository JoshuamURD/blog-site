# Daily Log
Today I mainly spent playing Dying Light 2. Last night I finished How to Kill a Mockingbird which had an amazing twist at the end. I've now begun reading Dune, but I'm not sure so far if it's my cup of tea. I really want to go down to the book store and buy some more books but I can't leave during iso. Covid symptoms have develope into an ear ache and a runny nose. JI can't tell if I'm getting better because everytime I think I am a new symptom will seem to replace an old one. I am getting sick of this an just want to be healthy again.
