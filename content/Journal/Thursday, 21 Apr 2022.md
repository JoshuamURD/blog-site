# Daily Log
Today I went to work. We stopped at M&M Walters for mum to sign their documents. While I was waiting I put up mum's car seats and attached her boot cover in the back of her car. I then went across the road to the coffee shop that is across from their office and ordered the usual flat white and skinny cappuccino. We then proceeded into Lawmac offices at the Esplanade. I only worked a half day and in that half day my main two jobs was finding a website that allowed a company search for a business located in the Cayman Islands which is a part of the UK. I ordered from a website that looked official called the Cayman Islands General Registry - eServices. I did not immediately receive the search results but suspect it will take some time. I then helped Lorraine Madden with some of her particulars for a miscellaneous licence application. Laura is coming over tonight at 3pm so I am going to go pick her up. This journal entry is done at 2:50pm
