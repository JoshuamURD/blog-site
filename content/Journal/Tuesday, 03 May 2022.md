I have definitely got COVID. I took a test this morning, it was negative, but it was one of the nasal tests, which I'm not too trusting of their accuracy - due to human error. My conclusion is on the basis that I've got a very scratchy throat and a dry cough. As the day has gone on, I've gained more of a feeling of being generally under the weather. My chest is sore and my eye sockets feel sore. I've decided that it's best that I don't exercise today. I need to be willing to make compromises with my fitness habits when it is beneficial to my health to do so. But still, I can hear David Goggin's mantras in my head with screaming at his accountability mirror to not make excuses. 

This morning, I received a text from Lachie asking what I'd said to Laura as she was texting him and seemed quite distraught. I had received a Snapchat from her, though, I can't remember what she'd said. I remember I'd sent her a message that I'd appreciate some discreetness on her part in regards to what's happened between us. At least with my own friends. Not long after, I started receiving several calls from her on every social media platform that permitted a call to be made. Snapchat, Facebook Messenger and regular phone calls vibrated my phone for several minutes. During this time, I was making my coffee, watching this go off. I felt a familiar anger and resentment boiling in me. The same one I felt now when confronted with any hysterical reaction from someone, especially a woman whom I was intimate with. This confirmed to me that I do indeed carry some serious baggage from my past relationships. Suffered from both Sarah and with Jade. I no longer have a tolerance for women in distress, whether explainable or not. After I'd completed my coffee making ritual I went outside to return the several missed calls by her and cries for help on text which were riddled with subtle suicidal threats - only adding to my disdain. When I got on the phone with her, she was inconsolable and barely comprehensible. After some moments had passed for her to regain her composure, we spent a good 40 minutes on the phone. She confessed to me that she was deeply enamored with me and that she'd never felt this way about anybody. I did have sympathy for this, being many times sat on the side she now was. I explained to her that my ceasing of our physical relationship was in consideration for her and that I was in no place to be able to have a healthy relationship with anybody. Which is not the whole reason, but certainly a large part of it. We eventually ended on the note that we were to try and be friends. Which I'm not too sure on how successful that will be.

The afternoon was then spent with me going between several different activities from reading, to playing on the Oculus Quest 2 and listening to music while trying to nap. I texted Sarah throughout the day about surface level topics. I'd suggested that when she finish prac, that we go camping. I'm not sure why I continue to text her despite the entire negative history we have. I think it's because until I am with someone who is capable of showing me the same level love and trust, I deep in my own mind, believe she's the only one who can feel that way about me. It makes her special and 'one-of-a-kind' in my mind. Irreplaceable. From my reading of the Attached by Dr. Amir, and from my own recollection, I'm able to be aware that this is definitely not the case. But alas, there still seems to be some part of me that believes that she is my soulmate. When I asked if she wanted to sleep in the same swag as me, I was met with the familiar feeling of meaning nothing to her when she responded that she would be "all good thanks". I'm aware that it's completely right and normal for her to respond this way but it just gives me clear disillusion in clear disparity between my feelings and hers.

Update: COVID feels like a really bad hangover mixed with a comedown. It feels like you're heavy, your head hurts, your throat is scratchy, you feel an occasional queasiness like you may throw-up and you feel super emotional
