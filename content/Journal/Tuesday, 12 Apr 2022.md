# Mental Health
## How are you feeling
Better than I was. The no smoking of weed or nicotine has been giving me anxiety. However, continuing to work on myself and set up systems for my life has been reducing this effect. I have noticed a significant increase in motivation since stopping and have never been so active.


## What's on your mind
I'm worried about the state of my friends. I'm currently quite distant from the group and am worried that I've outgrown my larger circle and the fact that Lachie and Jordan are likely going to become unavailable, this worry is metastizing. 


## What are you grateful for
I'm grateful for my parents and the stress free life they've given me since moving back in
