# Daily Log
I went to a bush doof with Sam, Ethan and all those people for Dan's 21st birthday. He's Millie Barwick's girlfriend. It was a really fun night and was the first time me properly trying out dexies. I noticed they made me really outgoing. It made my drunk feel like how it does when I have one of those really confident drunks. But I knew I couldn't have been that drunk cause I hadn't had a lot. 

Yesterday I was meant to go out with the group but I cancelled. I cancelled because Chelsie was coming over to stay. I've seen her the past three days in a row. We've been cuddling and kissing and last night she slept with her shirt off with me. When she touches me I get that spark. We're very different. She has quite a different sense of humour to me. But she's still a nice person and I feel great when I'm around her. Just really comfortable, but like still nervous in an exciting kind of way. In a way I haven't felt in a really long time. I'm not sure if I'm romantising her or not. I suppose I need to see where this goes though. I owe it that. She's also told me that she's deleted her dating apps. I've told her I did the same. I'm not sure why I did since this would probably imply to her that I'm intending it to be exclusive. I suppose I want that but some part of me still wants to explore what's going on with Cassie. Cassie told me today that she dreamt I'd kissed her and she wanted to go on a date. I saw her Friday night when I was clubbing. It was good to see her but we didn't talk too much cause her friends were really fucked up and she wasn't having a good time. 

I know I shouldn't be trying to weigh up my best option. I think I do because like with all things in my life, I feel like I'll make the wrong choice. I tend to romantasise a lot and be oblivious to certain things. I'm quite gullible, or at least have been in the past. So, now I worry that I'll make a wrong choice and miss out on something that could have been quite good if I had made the right one. It's also because I tend to stick with my choice once I've made it, whether for the good or bad. This can be because I'm a pussy when it comes to making someone feel bad, but it's also because I know that people and relationships can have their shit moments and it doesn't mean they're bad or not worth it on the whole. 

I've got a date organised with Cassie on Sunday. I'm seeing Chelsie on Friday. This is bad. But neither of them have given me any reason yet to date. Chelsie has made me do all the relationship work so far. Cassie has told me that she probably won't want to date and I've gotten the indication it's just a hookup thing, but she's put more effort in than Chelsie has and she's easier to talk to. It's hard. I'll be interested to see how this ier to talk to. It's hard. I'll be interested to see how this all pans out in the future.

# Mental Health
## How are you feeling
I'm feeling good but I'm worried I'm going to slip. I've been smoking my vape I bought on the weekend and I've been not doing workouts as much as I should since my COVID break. I'm going on a walk tomorrow morning and then going to gym as soon as I get home. My diet has been maintained mainly. I did eat an ice cream tonight though.
