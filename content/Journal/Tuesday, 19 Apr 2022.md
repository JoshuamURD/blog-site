# Daily Log
Today I discovered that my Samsung S7 Tab's keyboard had the D key missing. I gave it to Dad to attempt to fix and then I went to work. At work I attended a case see [[Allen Kelly vs Riversgold and Serendipity Resources]]. The case was attended with Dane, Amanda and Jacob. We stopped at a bar after for a couple drinks. I tried a French whiskey called Candid. When we got back to the office, Mum said that I should drive back myself as she had lots of work to do. As I got home, Dad had discovered all the components that are needed to fix the keyboard but as of writing this, we still haven't fixed it. We are eating pasta linguine tonight and I have been successful in logging my foods today. It is much easier though if I stick to only eating things that are made at home. Eating out doesn't work. I should also stick to not eating breakfast as to accommodate unexpected events where it would be weird for me not to eat. 

## Ideas 
I found a github repository that purports to have a program that can mass edit YAML frontmatter which would fix my future issue of changing tags in Obsidian.

## How are you feeling
I'm feeling pretty good. A little drained and cant be fucked doing a gym workout, especially after dinner. Will need to try and do it anyway.

## What's on your mind
I was anxious a lot of the day about the broken keyboard

## What are you grateful for
I'm grateful for Dad and the effort he goes to for anything I ask of him. He really cares and it shows through in the way he'll just spend so much time on something I ask of him in passing. I endevour to care about people's stuff as much as that. I need to work on my empathy.
