# Daily Log
Today I went for a run in the morning around the golf course as usual and then began working out my pull exercise. I then went to Silkwood way to pick up my washing machine and the last of my stuff there from Jordan. Sam as per usual did not seem to happy to see me. I then came back and tried to organise a haircut. I first went to the La Familia where the guy inside said that it was booking only and was quite dismissive. Acting like I shouldn't be there saying "it's easy bro. It's on the website. It's really easy". Like yeah I wasn't saying it was hard. I went to the Fade Doctor instead and got a haircut from an Irish woman called Lauren. She did a really good job. I then had Laura over. I didn't feel like having sex, but sometimes it feels like that's all she thinks i want (or maybe it's what she wants). I haven't had the courage yet to just tell her that sometimes I just want to cuddle. Maybe it's part of my anxious attachment. I need to find the courage to tell her it makes me uncomfortable when she's grabbing on my jockstrap when I'm just wanting to cuddle. We ended up having sex even though I wasn't particularly in the mood. I wasn't able to orgasm again from the insensitivity of wearing a condom. After that experience I dropped her off right away. It felt wrong and it made me feel disgusted with her and myself. I need to prevent this from being bottled up otherwise ill make a flash decision and get rid of her and I'll hurt her, regret it and hurt myself in the process. I also brought up again in the car ride home that I didn't feel ready for a relationship. Although, I think it came to my head to bring that up as that event had set me back with her a bit. She seemed to respond well but later has been questioning me about my interest in her because she must have picked up on my signals. I need talk to her next time i see her
