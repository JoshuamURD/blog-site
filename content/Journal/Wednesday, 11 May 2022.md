# Daily Log
Yesterday I pretty much spent the entire day just playing Dying Light 2. I've now finished it. The ending didn't tie off any loose ends and it ended pretty open ended. I'm kind of annoyed. Especially considering I cheated out on my exercise yesterday to play it. But whatever. Yesterday I also called Sarah. She made me feel like shit, like she does every time I speak to her. I'm not sure why I continue to speak to her now, knowing that nothing can happen from it. I think it's because its like mourning someone who's still alive. I have all these memories of a time that I was more happy than I ever was - and they're all during my formative years. I've more adult memories being with her than I do without her. I spent so much of my time only thinking of a future that included her in it. Old habits die hard I guess. I spoke with her about the idea of us camping or catching up and then she said that she feels like I keep mindfucking her because I spoke about Laura and Chelsie - even though she's made it no secret that she's fucking other people too. Not that I'd expect any less, its been long enough. But it's like she's only happy when I'm at a place where I'm pining over her, even though she doesn't want anything. It's not fair. But I can't be angry because I know this is who she is now. I still can't get rid of that residual feeling now - the one that I was left with after calling her. That feeling of anxiety and weight in my chest. Note to self, stop talking to her. To be honest, I think I also partly want to know one last time what its like to have sex with her. I have sex with her that's unreal because I know her body and she knows mine. There's no unknowns with it. It's easy and its a release that I only get with her. But I should stop idealising it. Because everytime I do, I end up disappointed with the reality.

Chelsie has been growing more and more distant again. I feel like I'm back to square one. I barely talk to her and she barely agrees to see me. When she does, she's always got a fresh excuse as to why we can't catch up. I may be overthinking this and I am sensitive to this kind of behaviour since Sarah. I'll give it a bit more time but if she doesn't start putting effort in, I'm walking. I need to realise that these kind of people, the avoidants, they don't change. I keep thinking that if enough work is put in, that if I give these types of people the space when they need it, that eventually I'll crack their defences and they'll actually open up to me. I was rewarded for this once, with Sarah, so now I think it'll always happen. 

Maybe I should just be alone right now. Just keep on gyming and getting fitter. Soon girls won't be an issue anymore. If I keep working and keep getting stronger and more money, I'll be at the point that I can have my pick of the girls. And I can finally make an educated decision on who to go with. I also need to start going out more and to get in the habit of just talking to women I don't know. I feel like this will come from the confidence of being fit though. I feel my confidence and cockiness growing already. Which is a good thing because the cockier I become, the more myself I am around people and people notice that kind of energy and are drawn to it.
