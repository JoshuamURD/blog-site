# Daily Log
I went to work today. Mum got me a big Easter chocolate rabbit. Most of what I did at work involved printing and collating. I did a bit of research on the originating process for starting proceedings in regards to repossessing a defaulted mortgaged property. I walked down the big hill for the first time today. It wasn't too challenging and I think I'm very nearly ready to transition my working out to running. I spoke to Jordan yesterday on the phone about my feeling distant in the group, he told me pretty much what Mum said, telling me that it's nothing to worry about and I just need to become a person who's on the 'invite list' in the forefront of their minds again. Which makes sense.

## Ideas 
- **Habits** - don't sit down before you've finished what you need to after getting home. Sitting down makes it significantly harder to regain momentum to keep working
- **Psychology** - Masculinity and fight club. Don't try and use comfort as a baseline to return back to. Life is meant to be experienced in discomfort. Pushing past and accepting discomfort grants true freedom.

# Mental Health
## How are you feeling
Didn't have much anxiety today. I've been feeling very focused on my goals and I'm hoping to continue this momentum.

## What's on your mind
Mildly worried about Laura. She's been acting very distant and cold. I'm not sure yet if this is her way of trying to get more attention or if it's something I should genuinely be concerned about. 

## What are you grateful for
I'm grateful for quitting vaping and smoking. I'm grateful for the benefits that's given me including my breath, my train of thoughts are better and i've saved a lot more money this week. 
I'm also grateful for my job. I'm happy that my jobs got my mum there as I feel a lot more comfortable.
