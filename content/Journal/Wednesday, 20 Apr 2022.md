# Daily Log
Today I went to work and mainly worked on the estate task that Josh Taylor assigned me. The estate consisted of 100s of collectable coins and medallions and 100s of trinkety novelty jewelry. All of which had to be photographed and itemised. Was very boring. But at least tomorrow is a half day.

## Ideas 
I've been doing the things I'm learning about in Atomic Habits sub-consciously.

# Mental Health
## How are you feeling
A little unmotivated. Feel like my initial weed break motivation high is beginning to plateau. This is why it's all the more important that I'm reading books on forming habits and not relying on motivation.

## What's on your mind

## What are you grateful for
I'm grateful for my playlists that help me get through difficult things. Let me focus on something else rather than the discomfort of life.

## What things are you trying to work on? What have you discovered about yourself?

# Fitness
## Did you exercise today?
Yes. Walked 3 times

## Did you reach a caloric deficit?
Maybe not. I ate a banana, went to sushi train and had ramen for dinner. I could be over but at least they're all healthy calories. This Friday I'm going to be buying soups to have for lunch to prevent stuff ups due to midday hunger. Then as long as I only get ramen for take out I'll be fine.
