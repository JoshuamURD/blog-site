# Daily Log
Today I went to work. The day went pretty slow, I only had the job of doing a chronology for Odette and then I did some more work on the Work Health and Safety Act that Cecilia requested a while ago. It sounded like she tried to blame me for not giving her more but in reality she had requested me to halt progress on it. At lunch I had a Katsu Don. It was the first thing I had eaten today. After lunch I walked to Dymocks and bought To Kill a Mockingbird, Dune and The Wheel Time. Three fiction books for my ongoing book habit. I wanted to walk more but it looked like it was going to rain. I need to get in the habit of bringing my waterproof jacket with me to work and have it readily available for mornings. Maybe I should leave it in my running pack. During the day the boys have organised to go to Magnet. I don't particularly feel like going especially since the cost of clubbing now makes me cringe. But, I want to.

Update: they cancelled, or more specifically, Jordan and Mitch cancelled because they have family coming over from Melbourne for Sam and Kerry's wedding so in turn that made Kris cancel on me. I have no doubt Kris will decide to go out by himself anyway. But to be honest, he may have changed his mind if I pushed but I chose not to.
