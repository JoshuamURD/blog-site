# Daily Log
Today I spent most of the day in a haze. The COVID feels like a hangover from cheap wine. I spent most of my time phasing in and out from sleep while watching Futurama. Rolling around in my bed and oscilatting between too hot and too cold. Which thanks to my personal aircon in my room, requires the remedy of sticking out a leg out of my doona. I got into a fight with mum today. I was too unwell today to make my usual weight loss meals of boiled eggs and Hart & Soul soups. So this morning I had three pieces of toast and for lunch, I couldn't even bear going downstairs so from the comfort of my room I decided to order a miso chicken ramen from Zushi Bento. When it arrived, mum was sitting in the living room and asked what I had. When I told her, she asked why I hadn't asked anyone else if they wanted Uber Eats. To me this seemed ridiculous since the only benefit from doing a combined order on Uber Eats was conventionally so everyone could pinch in on the delivery fees - which she did not have to worry about with Uber Eats Plus. When I tried to ask her for further clarification I was met with the accusation that "if I didn't already know why I should've aske then.." which to me seemed counterproductive. I genuinely wanted to understand if I had missed some sort of social etiquitte and why it was in place. To me, I'd ordered Uber Eats, out of my own pocket, and if the others having been inspired by me wanted to order something as well, the only difference woul be is it would be an hour behind me having received mine. No harm, no foul. It wasn't a case that we were meant to be eating lunch together and therefore I'd be eating while the rest had to wait. I had intended to take that lunch into my room. So the whole situation confused me. And, because mum is sick as well, she decided to amp it up and throw in her guilt-ridden comments such as "i've raised you better than that". But still refused to explain to me the nuances of why what I did was wrong. 

Besides that, nothing else of note happened today. I decided to still withhold from my exercise until I've reached a point of better health
