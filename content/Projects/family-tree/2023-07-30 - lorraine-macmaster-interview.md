# Summary 

This interview nan spoke of her grandparents, Oscar (a strict but nice heavily religious man) and Caity (a native American woman), who were both very loved by her. She lived in a small area that consisted of a small highly rural area attached to a town of roughly 2000 people. She first went to school at a town house that only had one teacher who taught all grade levels at the same time. She stayed at this school until she was 6 but she never got taught the foundations because she was considered gifted for her age and so immediately they began teaching her 3rd grade content. She stayed at this town one classroom school for a couple of years before moving her to the big town, New Lise. There was where she attended the rest of her education and also where she learned how to play piano. She got given an allowance which she would use to get lessons and her brother, Ivan, used to get this same allowance - although, he spent his allowance on going to the movies. 

Her parents split up for a while when she was young (she can't recall being told why) and at this time she lived with her mother in Winnapeg. It wasn't long that her father and mother got back together and they all lived together in a farm in the rural area outside of town with her grandmother and grandfather (Oscar and Caity). Her grandmother and Lorraine were very close, bonded by their mutual love of reading. Lorraine and Caity would go foraging for wild berries with Caity's native American expertise. She also told me that Caity was prone to escaping out the window when unwanted visitors would be at the house. 

Nan was in a choir called the Ladies Philharmonic Choir,  she was in this choir from the age of 9 and remained in it until she was 17. The choir used to have many groups competing from across Canada where they competed in Toronto. They did exceptionally well, winning the tournament when she was 17 and they grand prize of a trip. They however never got to use this prize as their teacher unfortunately passed away at that time.

Lorraine loved her father a lot. She spoke of him as a man of business and humour. He was well-educated she said.
