Pharmaceutical manufacturers have been convicted of falsifying test results nding an increased risk of side e ects, resulting in patients su ering needless injury or death. Oil companies have been convicted of causing major spills leading to property damage, lost earnings, and environmental harm. Ultimately, the study of white-collar or corporate crime costs is not much di erent from that of street crime: both require a comprehensive look at a host of harmful outcomes, including monetary, psychological, and health-related impacts. What makes the study of white-collar crime costs more di cult is the lack of consistent victimization data and the fact that much whitecollar crime involves regulatory o enses and/or occurs during legitimate business activities.},

The objective of this study is to systematically review 804 scholarly publications related to big data analytics in health in order to identify the organizational and social values along with associated challenges. Key principles of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology were followed for conducting systematic reviews. Following a research path, we present the values, challenges and future directions of the scientific area using indicative examples from relevant published articles. The study reveals that one of the main values created is the development of analytical techniques which provides personalized health services to users and supports human decision-making using automated algorithms, challenging the power issues in the doctor-patient relationship and creating new working conditions. A main challenge to data analytics is data management and security when processing large volumes of sensitive, personal health data. Future research is directed towards the development of systems that will standardize and secure the process of extracting private healthcare datasets from relevant organizations. Our systematic literature review aims to provide to governments and health policymakers a better understanding of how the development of a data driven strategy can improve public health and the functioning of healthcare organizations but also how can create challenges that need to be addressed in the near future to avoid societal malfunctions.},

Most have some higher education, are married, and have moderate to strong ties to community, family, and religious organizations. White-collar o enders usually have a criminal history, including infractions that span the spectrum of illegality, but many do not overindulge in vice.

The paper proposes three different organisational configurations, which describe the connections among educational actors in a national system. The ultimate goal is to provide insights about alternative organisational settings for the adoption of data analytics in education.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The paper is based on a participant observation approach applied in the Italian educational system. The study is based on four research projects that involved teachers, school principals and governmental organisations over the period 2017\textendash 2020.                                         Findings               As a result, the centralised, the decentralised and the network-based configurations are presented and discussed according to three organisational dimensions of analysis (organisational layers, roles and data management). The network-based configuration suggests the presence of a network educational data scientist that may represent a concrete solution to foster more efficient and effective use of educational data analytics.                                         Originality/value               The value of this study relies on its systemic approach to educational data analytics from an organisational perspective, which unfolds the roles of schools and central administration. The analysis of the alternative organisational configuration allows moving a step forward towards a structured, effective and efficient system for the use of data in the educational sector.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}This paper presents findings from a study of Australian and New Zealand academics (n = 276) that teach tertiary education students. The study aimed to explore participants' early experiences of learning analytics in a higher education milieu in which data analytics is gaining increasing prominence. Broadly speaking participants were asked about: (1) Their teaching context, (2) Their current student retention activities, (3) Their involvement in, and aspirations for, learning analytics use, (4) Their relationship with their institution around learning analytics. The sampled teaching staff broadly indicated a high level of interest but limited level of substantive involvement in learning analytics projects and capacity building activities. Overall, the intention is to present a critical set of voices that assist in identifying and understanding key issues and draw connections to the broader work being done in the field.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A smart way for achieving such feedback is the introduction of automated feedback techniques, enabled by the vast number of electronic support systems that help teachers in their activities. Online fora, assessment environments, and other educational support systems do not only provide an environment to manage course content, but also the means to and the data of interacting with students in a fast and personal way.},

  abstract = {In this study, we have proposed and implemented a sequential data analytics (SDA)-driven methodological framework to design adaptivity for digital game-based learning (DGBL). The goal of this framework is to facilitate children's personalized learning experiences for K-5 computing education. Although DGBL experiences can be beneficial, young children need personalized learning support because they are likely to experience cognitive challenges in computational thinking (CT) development and learning transfer. We implemented the educational game Penguin Go to test our methodological framework to detect children's optimal learning interaction patterns. Specifically, using SDA, we identified children's diverse gameplay patterns and inferred their learning states related to CT. To better understand children's gameplay performance and CT development in context, we used qualitative data as triangulation. We discuss adaptivity design based on the children's gameplay challenges indicated by their gameplay sequence patterns. This study shows that SDA can inform what in-game support is necessary to foster student learning and when to deliver such support in gameplay. The study findings suggest design guidelines regarding the integration of the proposed SDA framework.},
