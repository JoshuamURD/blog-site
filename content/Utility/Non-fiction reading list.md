> [!example]- Note's purpose
> Index notes can be seen as the "furthest zoomed out" notes of the vault. They represent a map of concepts and ideas or are strictly for utility. Index notes may also contain some meta information about a certain topic but only rudimentary as anything deeper should be captured in a concept or idea note

# Meta 

A reading list to keep track of what I want to read and what I've already read in non-fiction. 

My current **top of mind**: 
- Books on learning;
- Books on zettlekasten;
- Books on second brain or PKMs.

# Books

I'm trialing managing this on goodreads
