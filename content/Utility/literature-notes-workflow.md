# Tags

Upon creating a new note for a piece of literature in the inbox, you should consider and add tags that relate to the relevant themes or main ideas being portrayed in the book. It may be a non-fiction book about productivity for example, and this would call for a tag for productivity. Make sure any new tags are added to the [[tag-taxonomy|tag-taxonomy]]. 

However, the first step should be to look at the tags pane in obsidian and decide if any of the tags currently available are applicable to the new piece of literature.

If you're taking notes from a web article. Make sure to include the link in the YAML.


# How to take literature notes
The most important thing is actually taking the notes. It may change what works best for you. It will also depend on the medium in which you're doing your reading. If you have a physical book you may have to annotate and then come back later to start typing them into Obsidian. If you're taking notes on a digital book, at least these can be imported. Consider making a zotero workflow for this so you can import and cite in any note.

Currently, I've really enjoyed the process suggested by Vicky Zhao, the [[QEC method|QEC method]].

# What to do after highlighting book

Rephrase into your own worxs and atomise. Onky keep quotes when directly necessary.

# Physical notes
According to the QEC method,[^1] it's best to annotate physical books with:
- what may be a possible question, point or proposition (usually denoted by  highlight or underline);
- what may be evidence to support that question, point or proposition (usually denoted by a dot); and
- any conclusions the author draws from the evidence and links back to the original point (usualyl denoted by a dash).

## Digital notes
I've decided to employ this system on my PDF notes as well except to use highlighting colours to denote a Q, E or C.
- **Yellow** - will denote a question, point or proposition.
- **Green** - will denote evidence to support the theory or point or proposition.
- **Blue** - will denote a conclusion or linking back to a proposition.
- **Red** - highly important quotes that really resonated with me.
