# 1. Topic Tags

General note tags are topic tags. They are early concept notes. Ones where the topics have not been studied enough to constitute a Map of Content - they have not met the "[[mental squeeze point]]" but I anticipate that they have topics in them I'll later want to group.

- **#note-taking** - content which describes a note-taking methodology.
- **#productivity** - notes which describe methods of improving efficiency in an aspect of life or thinking.
- **#zettlekasten** - notes on ideal zettlekasten note-taking methods.
- **#obsidian** - notes on an obsidian system or methodology or plugin.
- **#fitness** - notes on fitness and working out.
- **#macmaster-family-tree** - I'm trying to out together a family tree archive 

# 2. Zettlekasten Tags

- **#index** -a tag for a note which only contains links to other indexes or concepts. Can be thought of as an index of indexes. Also may contain some metadata if within a project folder such as what the project is for and such.

An index may be delineated from a concept because an index note is more of a documentation note. It contains metadata. A concept note asks questions of the vault and has pre-setup and curated idea notes as answers.

- **#concept** - a tag for a map of content (MoC) which contains the grouping of several individual ideas into one overarching concept. This will occur once reaching the "[[Mental Squeeze Point]]".

Concept notes begin to form when ideas need to be grouped under one umbrella. Think of this like a map of content or asking a question and having the vault answer back by grouping several ideas to form a basic structure of an answer. An example could be "What is soundness of mind?" as a concept note, with several ideas linking different legal principles to determine this as their own idea notes (which link to evidence notes such as cases). Concepts can also be the accumulation of multiple ideas in the form of a question such as "what is X"?

- **#idea** - a tag for an idea or assertion in the [[QEC method|QEC zettlekasten method]].

An idea can be thought of as a single assertion or micro-topic. A legal principle which can be seen as atomic could be: ^ff04bd

> [!Help] Example idea note
> **Title of note:** contract-requires-intent-to-bind
**Note:** For there to be a valid contract, there is a requirement that the parties intend to enter into a legally binding agreement
**Evidence:** Some v Case [2021] HCA 2022
**Possible connections:** determining intent (concept), requirements of valid contract (concept), intention can be implied (idea).

- **#questions** - a tag for a question I've thought of when reading a literature note. Questions are to be later filled with ideas from my further research which could connect or answer them. Once this is complete, they can become a concept note. 

# 3. Literature Notes Tags

Literature notes are anything reading related. Classify it according to the following (maybe it could be more than one):

- **#literature-note** - all literature notes have this tag
- **#literary-philosophy** - for primary source books on philosophy
- **#literary-poetry** - for poetry books and collections of poetry
- **#literary-fiction** - for novels and other storytelling fiction with literary commentary
- **#non-fiction-book** - for books which contain factual based information to explain ideas.
- **#web-article** - an article from the web. For this make sure to include a link.
- **#video-note** - notes for videos of various kinds

# 4. University Notes Tags

- **#university** - for notes relating to ones taken in university. This tag requires you use the sub-tag to indicate which unit code it is.
	- **#university/llb230** -  for notes relating to my white collar crime unit.
	- **#university/llb316** - for notes relating to my taxation law unit.
	- **#university/llb323** - for notes relating to my social and welfare law unit.
	- **#university/msp202** - for notes relating to my data analytics unit.
		- **#university/msp202/assignment1** - for notes relating to research done for the purposes of my data analytics assignment on educational analytics.

## Types of university content
- **#university-lecture** - for university notes taken in a lecture.
- **#university-reading** -  for university notes taken by a reading (i.e cases, articles, legislation notes). Can be seen as university literature notes - for zettlekasten.
- **#university-assignment** - for university assignment notes

# 5. Zotero tags and PDF annotations
This is metadata on how tags are managed in Zotero, my current citation manager.

- No tags on a material indicates its a fresh import which hasn't been processed at all.
- **tablet** - sent to tablet for reading. This indicates to me that literature is ready to read.
- **tablet_modified** - indicates to me that I've created new annotations on my tablet.
- **ready-to-extract** - I've finished reading and highlighting, I've retrieved the PDF from my tablet and now I merely need to import the annotations to Obsidian.
- **done** - indicates that I've finished reading, annotated the content, pulled the annotations from the literature and imported the annotations into Obsidian.
- **annotation colours -**
	- **Yellow** - general / idea note;
	- **Green** - evidence meaning that the author is relying on outside sources from someone else's work that isn't their original idea.
	- **Blue** - For questions/concepts - highlights of an idea(s) that should contribute to a larger concept or question.
