# For lectures and readings
## Phase one - reading and annotating
1. Download the reading or lecture slide and place in the relevant sub-folder on Zotero.
2. Use the Zotero "zotfile" plugin to right-click and "send to subfolder on tablet" which will send the PDF file to Onedrive, mimicking the sub-folder structure on Zotero.
3. Read, highlight and annotate on tablet the material. 
4. Once complete of material sent to tablet, go to Zotero and go to "New annotations" folder.
5. Right click and click the "get from tablet" to retrieve all the annotations. This will generate the annotations file too.
6. The yellowy looking annotations file, right click it and click export. Export it as markdown into the vault inbox.
7. Use the citations plugin to create a citations note with the correct template and metadata. This should be created in the literature-notes sub-folder in the "Areas" sub-folder.
8. Copy and paste the annotations into the literature note and delete the annotations note when you're finished.
9. Give the note the relevant tags. 
10. Make it look nice if there's been some formatting errors.

## Phase two - conversion to atomic notes
1. Go through each literature note and pull out ideas that are highly relevant.
2. Place the ideas as their own notes (atomic notes) and use the "idea-note-template" to format it. Make sure the idea note links back to the literature note.
3. Ensure that the note/idea is "decontextualised" meaning that if you found that note on its own without the source or any other material to provide context, you'd be able to understand what it was discussing.
4. Once all ideas are pulled from the literature note, mark complete.

## Phase three - connecting atomic notes
1. Go through university idea notes regularly and connect the ideas using the compass method.
2. Once ideas are connected to a few other ideas, this should mark the process as complete.
