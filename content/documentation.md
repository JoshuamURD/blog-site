# Zettlekasten
Zettlekasten is a phrase that is getting more and more popular. It describes a form of note-taking that was popularized by Nickolas Luuhman who was a prolific writer of his time. Luuhman attributed all of his amassed publications to his workflow which he termed the "zettlekasten" (german for slipbox). The principles of the zettlekasten were originally designed under Luuhman's system using index cards as notes. The Shared Experience
