# Hello ðŸŽˆ

This is the shared experience which is a bit of a social experiment in which the collaborators, Sam and Josh, attempt to determine whether the convergence of a bottom up structured knowledge base will cause idea emergence. In that, we will collaboratively and separately undertake academic studies in which we:
- rephrase and take notes from literature that interests us, creating [[literature notes]];
- decontextualize and distill [[atomic idea]] from our literature notes; and
- spend time perusing this vault to find potential connections of new ideas to what we already know or has already been added. This will allow ideas to grow and [[form connections between ideas]]

In doing so, we will attempt a [[daily writing practice]] and [[study]] various topics together. These topics will be distilled into their [[atomic idea]].

Have a look at our [[documentation]] to see how the principles of how this digital garden operates. Alternatively, look at our [[tag taxonomy]] to get an understanding of our tagging system to browse topics that way. Otherwise, use the graph or search functions integrated in this website.
