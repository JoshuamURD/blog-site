# Hello ðŸŽˆ

This is the shared experience which is a bit of a social experiment in which the collaborators, Sam and Josh, attempt to determine whether the convergence of bottom up knowledge base will cause idea emergence.

In doing so, we will attempt a [[daily writing practice]] and [[study]] various topics together. These topics will be distilled into their [[atomic idea]].

# Need a launching in point? ðŸ˜Ž

Have a look at our [[documentation]] to see how the principles of how this digital garden operates. Alternatively, look at our [[tag taxonomy]] to get an understanding of our tagging system to browse topics that way. Otherwise, use the graph or search functions integrated in this website.
